He composed over 600 works, many acknowledged as pinnacles of symphonic, concertante, chamber, piano, operatic, and choral music. He is among the most enduringly popular of classical composers. \n \nMozart showed prodigious ability from his earliest childhood in Salzburg. Already competent on keyboard and violin, he composed from the age of five and performed before European royalty. At 17 he was engaged as a court musician in Salzburg, but grew restless and travelled in search of a better position, always composing abundantly. While visiting Vienna in 1781, he was dismissed from his Salzburg position. He chose to stay in the capital, where he achieved fame but little financial security. During his final years in Vienna, he composed many of his best-known symphonies, concertos, and operas, and portions of the Requiem, which was largely unfinished at the time of Mozart's death. The circumstances of his early death have been much mythologized. He was survived by his wife Constanze and two sons.

During the nineties, she continued singing and also wrote for anime seiyū. From 2000, she became involved in earnest with anime and composed several songs for Wedding Peach, Fruits Basket and Love Hina. She formed the duo Melocure in 2002 with singer-songwriter Megumi Hinata, and in the following two years, the duo released several singles and an album, Melodic Hard Cure. Okazaki also produced songs during these years for artists such as Megumi Hayashibara, Mayumi Iizuka, and Yui Horie. \n \nHer work consists mainly of ballads, and can be categorised within the spectrum of Japanese music as most closely related to J-Pop.

From that time on, her studies of voice and composition have never stopped. \n \nDuring her education at the Novosibirsk Musical College (1986-1990), she participated in various themed-based festivals and competitions, refining her own style as a popular singer on stage. \n \nIn December 1990, she went to Japan on a 3-month personal invitation and took part in several festivals in the City of Sapporo, where she represented the Russian culture. At the same time, she signed a contract with the ROAD &amp; SKY Company, and, in May of 1994, she went to Tokyo to record her first album and later continue her career as a singer and composer. ORIGA's contract with ROAD &amp; SKY remained valid until her death. \n \nWith her initial musical appearance in the style of Healing Music, ORIGA recorded 4 full albums, 2 mini albums and later a \"Selected Songs\" album through TOSHIBA EMI Records in the period from 1994 through 1999. Her [EIEN \"Eternity\"] album was the first Russian language album to appear on the Japanese national hit chart ORICON, and it took the 64th place. The \"Polyushko-Pole\" song from the album was used as a theme song for the famous TBS Channel TV series \"Ao no Jidai\" (Blue Era). During that time, ORIGA took part in various projects with leading Japanese pop artists as a back-vocals producer, worked on advertisements and commercials on radio and television (on the national NHK channel) and performed in music concerts. \n \nAfter a long maternity leave, in 2003 ORIGA took part in recording several main theme songs for the anime series \"Stand Alone Complex O.S.T\" together with Yoko Kanno, which brought her vast popularity in the world of anime and led to subsequent work in other anime projects. At the same time, she changed her style to Electronica and started to produce her songs independently, releasing, through GEMMATIKA Records, albums \"Era of Queens\" and \"Aurora\", as well as a remake album of her own songs titled \"The Songwreath\". \n \nSince 2008, ORIGA had been invited to participate as a lead singer in the project by a popular Japanese guitarist SUGIZO. Under this project, she had taken part in several concerts and a concert tour abroad. \n \nPrior to her death, ORIGA still performed as a vocalist in a variety of projects. One of them, \"Starry Tales\" for the World Digital Planetariums. This work was in tandem with synthesizer player Himekami and brilliant artist Kagaya. In 2012, she participated in recording three soundtracks for video game \"Final Fantasy XIII-2\". \n \n(Source: Official website) \n \nMALoween remembers you. \nH\n \n ","name":"Origa","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/4579/original.jpg"},{"id":"9392","description":"","name":"Masamune Ochiai"},{"id":"7933","description":"  Blood type: O \n \nDebut role was Yoshino Takatsuki in Hourou Musuko.

After working in a wide range of genres, he made his breakthrough film Rashômon (1950) in 1950. It won the top prize at the Venice Film Festival, and first revealed the richness of Japanese cinema to the West. The next few years saw the low-key, touching Ikiru (1952) (Living), the epic Shichinin no samurai (1954) (Seven Samurai) and the barbaric, riveting Shakespeare adaptation Kumonosu jô (1957) (Throne of Blood), the later two showcasing the magnetic personality of Toshirô Mifune, who also starred in the two samurai comedies Yojimbo (1961) and Tsubaki Sanjûrô (1962). After a lean period in the late 1960s and early 1970s, though, Kurosawa attempted suicide. He survived, and made the Russian co-production Dersu Uzala (1975) and, with the help of admirers Francis Ford Coppola and George Lucas, the samurai epic Kagemusha (1980), which was in many ways a dry run for Ran (1985), his second Shakespeare adaptation. He continued to work into his eighties with the more personal Dreams (1990), Hachi-gatsu no kyôshikyoku (1991) and Madadayo (1993). Kurosawa's films have always been more popular in the West than in his native Japan, where critics have viewed his adaptations of Western genres and authors (William Shakespeare, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Maxim Gorky and Evan Hunter) with suspicion - but he's revered by American and European film-makers, who remade Shichinin no samurai (1954), as The Magnificent Seven (1960), Yojimbo (1961), as Per un pugno di dollari (1964) and Kakushi-toride no san-akunin (1958), as Star Wars (1977). \n \nreference: http://www.imdb.com \n \nKurosawa died on September 6th 1998.

After graduating from university, he became a founding member of Yuji Saito's music production company IMAGINE in November 1986. \n \nThe company has grown to feature musicians like Kohei Tanaka, Shiro Hamaguchi, Hayato Matsuo, and Shinji Miyazaki, who have become well known for cinematic scoring and orchestration through Otani. In 1987, he made his debut as an anime composer with the popular manga adaptation City Hunter, which earned him recognition in the industry. \n \nHe later went on to work on titles such as Spy Games (1988), The Ultimate Teacher (1988), The Yadamura Waltz (1988), and You're Under Arrest (1994). The anime Future GPX Cyber Formula (1991) and Mobile Suit Gundam Wing (1995) and several films in the Gamera series are some of his most well-known works. \n \nIn 2001, he created the score to the film Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack. Other notable scores by Otani include Outlaw Star (1998), Gundam Wing: Endless Waltz (1998), Cross Fire (2000), The SoulTaker (2001), Haibane Renmei (2002), Zatch Bell! (2003), Eyeshield 21 (2005), Pumpkin Scissors (2006), Deltora Quest (2007), and Over Drive (2007). He has also been the music director and keyboardist of the band Dreams Come True. He appeared at Eminence Symphony Orchestra's events A Night in Fantasia 2007: Symphonic Games Edition and Unearthing Eden ~The sounds of AINARU~ in 2007. \n \nThroughout his career, Otani has also composed music for several video games, making his debut with the 1995 shooter game Philosoma. In 2000, he created the soundtrack to the flight simulator Sky Odyssey. He scored Shadow of the Colossus in 2005, his most famous video game work. Otani was responsible for composing the music for Wild Arms: Twilight Venom (2000), an anime adaptation of the Wild Arms video game series; he also arranged compositions of Michiko Naruke's music from the series. He did two more video game to anime adaptations: Night Warriors: Darkstalkers' Revenge (1997) and Popolocrois Monogatari (1998).

He wrote the background music for several notable anime, including the award-winning soundtrack of the Sailor Moon anime series. \n \nHe died of bladder cancer at 54 years of age. \n \nAs the Music Director for Sailor Moon, Arisawa's first award was the 1993 Golden Disk Grand Prize from Columbia Records. He continued to compose for the entire anime series, plus several video games and some of the stage musicals. In 1998, 2000, and 2001 he won the JASRAC International Award for most international royalties, owing largely to the popularity of Sailor Moon music in other nations. \n \nArisawa expressed an admiration of Hollywood-style music, drawing his initial inspiration for the tone of the Sailor Moon soundtrack from the Charlie's Angels TV series. He frequently made use of symbolism when writing themes for specific characters or groups, borrowing thematic elements from diverse genres and from other countries. As the series progressed, his music gravitated from a pop feeling toward more classical arrangements to represent the protagonist having passed through painful experiences and grown as a person. \n \nSource: Wikipedia  ","name":"Takanori Arisawa","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/4575/original.jpg"},{"id":"23353","description":" Wikipedia","name":"Motoo Fujiwara","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/23353/original.jpg"},{"id":"26162","description":"","name":"Akimitsu Honma"},{"id":"15993","description":" AniDB","name":"Ikuto Yamashita","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/15993/original.jpg"},{"id":"276","description":" \n  Birthname  \n Nakagawa (中川) Shiyouko (しようこ) \nBirthplace: Nakano, Tokyo, Japan \nNickname: Shokotan (しょこたん), Shokotatsu (ショコタス) \nBlood type: A \nHeight: 156cm \nBWH: 84-58-84 \n \nShe is a Japanese idol, tarento, actress, seiyuu (voice actor), illustrator and singer.

One of these films, Gravitation, which was later featured at the 2005 Tehran International Short Film Festival, caught the attention of both the Japanese broadcasting giant NHK and Madhouse. NHK quickly contacted her with an offer to have her animate a music video segment for the popular and long running short film program Minna no Uta (Everyone's Songs), which was designed to highlight upcoming independent animators and musicians. However, by this time she had already been hired by Madhouse as a production assistant, and feeling that it would not be right to accept freelance work outside of the studio, she turned them down. However, the Minna no Uta staff was unwilling to give up, and they requested that Madhouse take on the music video project with Ishizuka as director.

Because of her interest in Russia she is also affectionately known under the nickname Sumipe (すみぺ, the letter R resembles a P in Russia's Cyrillic Alphabet). Other nicknames include Suminya (スミーニャ), because she likes to wear nekomimi accessory, and Gundanchou (軍団長, Corps Commander) because of her interest in military, especially tanks, and her radio show. \n \nAt the age of eight Uesaka was scouted by Space Craft Junior Commercial Talent right when she was going home after an EIKEN Test in Practical English Proficiency. Afterwards she appeared in a Japanese Vidal Sassoon CM. In 2009 she took part in the Web Radio@Dengeki Bunko web radio, where she became a regular between September 2009 and December 2011. During her work there she wanted to breath life into her work, which became one of her inspirations to aspire to become a voice actress. Her other inspiration was voice actress Momoi Haruko, who she respects after she incidentally saw <i>Nurse Witch Komugi-chan Magikarte</i> when she was still a primary school student. Uesaka described the experience as shocking but it was there that she heard Momoi for the first time and yearned to become a voice actress afterwards. In April, 2011 she joined Space Craft Entertainment's anime section. Starting October 7, 2011 she became a radio personality on A&amp;G NEXT GENERATION Lady Go!!. Following an announcement on August 12 of the same year at the Summer Comic Market 80, it was announced that she had being casted on the 2012 TV anime series <i>Papa no Iukoto wo Kikinasai!</i>. In January 2012 she made her debut as voice actress, lending her voice to the heroine Takanashi Sora. Later Matsu Tomohiro, the original author, and Kawasaki Itsurou, the director, said that she was chosen at the audition despite technical flaws, because they couldn't picture anyone else as Sora. Following her first starring role she became gradually more busy during 2012. \n \nUesaka is an avid fan of Russia and its history, culture, military, literature and art. This traces back to the time when she was a tenth grade student, in her first year of high school, and heard by chance for the first time the Soviet Union national anthem. Henceforth she began to develop an interest in Russia and devoted herself to studying about Russian society and history on her own. She couldn't picture herself studying anything other than Russian language at university. In April 2010, she entered the Faculty of Foreign Studies at the well known Sophia University after a recommendation from Kamakura Women's University Junior &amp; Senior High School where she graduated. There she was majoring in Russian Studies. Her graduation thesis was a study of the early history of the Red Army. On July 10, 2012 she received Sophia University's Studies Prize For Excellent Work. \n \nStarting April, 2012 she received her own radio show, the Uesaka Sumire's Armored Guards Infantry Regiment Broadcast on Nico Nico Live. Because of her familiarity with Russia and interest in its military, she was casted as the Russian girl Nonna on TV anime series <i>Girls und Panzer</i> in October 2012. She also sung two Russian insert songs during the show, \"Cossack no Komoriuta\" and \"Katyusha,\" both covers of well known folk songs. Her performance as voice actress and singer received a lot of attention in Japan and overseas thereafter. \n \nUesaka likes to study languages and is, aside of Russian, proficient in English and Chinese as well, having passed several language proficiency tests. She also likes Lolita Fashion and as such became a model for the Baby, The Stars Shine Bright clothing brand. Photo shoots with her are published frequently in Kera, Gothic &amp; Lolita Bible and other well known magazines. She likes to draw and often posts illustrations on her blog and pixiv account. Her favorite food includes lamb chop and Kinoko no Yama. Her favorite politician is Vyacheslav Molotov, her favorite manga and anime characters are Chirico Cuvie, Duke Tougou and Rudolf von Stroheim. Her favorite tank is the BT-5 produced by the Soviet Union. On May 26, 2012 she served as a one-day captain of the JS Yamayuki at the Marine Fiesta in Funabashi. \n \n(Source: AniDB) \n \nTwitter: @uesaka_official\n  ","name":"Sumire Uesaka","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/8362/original.jpg"},{"id":"23678","description":"","name":"Kouji Kobayashi"},{"id":"1567","description":"  Also known as: \n \n松下ユキヒロ (Matsushita Yukihiro) \nユキヒロ (Yukihiro)  ","name":"Yukihiro Matsushita","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/1567/original.jpg"},{"id":"22381","description":"","name":"Chikako Yokota","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/22381/original.jpg"},{"id":"2694","description":"  Real name: (村田 蓮爾 Murata Renji) \n \nBirthplace:  Osaka, Japan \nMale \nZodiac:  Aquarius \nBlood Type:  AB \n \nRenji \"Range\" Murata is a Japanese artist and designer, known for his unique style combining Art Deco and Japanese Anime elements.

He started to work in animation in 1962, before he began drawing comics. Hayashi started to draw for the magazine Garo in 1967 and soon became very well-known thanks to his comic Red Colored Elegy, which became something of a social phenomenon. Depicting the daily life of a couple that is not married (an arrangement that is nothing new in this day and age, but was not nearly as acceptable in 1970), Hayashi shows their feelings in a metaphorical but accurate way that still resonates decades later. Its influence in Japan was so large that Morio Agata, a prominent Japanese folk musician and singer songwriter, debuted with a love song written and named after it. In 2007, it was made into an animation. \n \nThis description is from the short biography on the Drawn and Quarterly website: http://www.drawnandquarterly.com/artBio.php?artist=a46cdb44d6e400   ","name":"Seiichi Hayashi","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/13755/original.jpg"},{"id":"5898","description":"  Hironobu Sakaguchi co-founded Square with Masafumi Miyamoto in September of 1983. Their first games were very unsuccessful, so with no other choice, the pair decided to conclude their stay in the game industry by creating one title with the rest of Square's available funds. They called it: Final Fantasy. The game was released in Japan for the Famicom (also known internationally as the Nintendo Entertainment System) on December 18, 1987 and became an instant hit across Japan. This, of course, surprised Sakaguchi-san, who decided to delay his retirement. Final Fantasy developed into a successful franchise under his watchful eye, and now spans from stand alone stories to spin-offs and direct sequels. After directing every title in the flagship series through Final Fantasy V) for the Super Famicom, he took on the role of executive producer for the series, along with producing many of Square's other game projects. \n \nSakaguchi has enjoyed a distinguished career in game development with his titles selling over 80 million units worldwide. A long-time proponent of bringing together the story-telling tradition of film and the interactive elements of games, he took on the directorial role on Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, an animated motion picture loosely based on previously established Final Fantasy series themes. Unfortunately, the movie was a catastrophic financial failure, the second-biggest animated box office bomb in cinema history, losing over $120 million and leading to the closure of Square Pictures. The upset, for which Sakaguchi was responsible, affected Square's financial capital, and may well have precipitated the merger with rival role-playing game creator Enix. As a consequence, feelings towards Sakaguchi's tenure at Square are somewhat mixed. \n \nIn 2000, Sakaguchi became the third person inducted into the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences' Hall of Fame. After voluntarily resigning from Square, he founded the game development studio Mistwalker with the financial backing of Microsoft Game Studios. In February of 2005 it was announced that Mistwalker would be working with Microsoft Game Studios to produce two role-playing titles for the Xbox 360 game console. Nevertheless, despite Microsoft's financial backing, Mistwalker remains independent of console exclusivity. Apart from Blue Dragon and Lost Odyssey, Sakaguchi is also producing Archaic Sealed Heat for Nintendo DS. He has at least three more titles planned for Nintendo game consoles.

However, having failed the entrance exam for Takarazuka Music School in her third year of middle-school she joined the Minami Aoyama Shōjo Kageki Dan (南青山少女歌劇団, South Aoyama Female Opera Group?, also called Nanshō for short) a stage group for teenage girls. \n \nHaving had several lead roles over the three years she spent with the troupe, Saeko was then cast in the lead voice acting role of Kotori Haruno in the Sega Dreamcast game Diamond Daydreams. Having had a taste of being a seiyū and deciding that she preferred voice acting to performing on stage, Saeko decided to pursue the career full-time. \n \nSome of her earlier roles include her seiyū debut as Tsubaki Sakura in Kare Kano, Kitsune no Akane in Angel Tales, and Elliot Chapman in Sci-fi Harry. Saeko was famed for her long, straight, black hair and seemingly cold outward appearance which led to her being cast in various tsundere and 'cool-girl' roles. She then cut her hair short in the spring of 2005, which strangely coincided with the increasing diversity of her roles, as Saeko herself noted on the My-HiME fandisc interview. \n \nSaeko has also pursued a singing career with Yuki Kajiura, who wrote music for some of the Nanshō stage shows, writing and producing almost all her material. Her first single was Koi no Kiseki, the theme song for the PlayStation game Meguri Aishite. She has since released nine singles and two albums, along with various character song and drama CDs. She has also performed theme songs for games such as Alundra 2 and Atelier Judie. \n \nSaeko was also part of the group tiaraway with fellow Nanshō member Yuuka Nanri. Originally recording and performing as 'Saeko Chiba &amp; Yuuka Nanri' for Memories Off 2nd, the duo released three singles and an album before breaking up on  March 6 2005. \n ","name":"Saeko Chiba","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/2137/original.jpg"},{"id":"62","description":" \n  Birthplace  \n New York, New York, United States \nCurrent residence: Los Angeles, California, United States \n \nShe is a voice actor, stage actor, singer, and dancer. \nSister of voice actors Tom Fahn and Jonathan Fahn.

Sugimori drew all of the original 151 Pokémon himself. He has worked on the various Pokémon movies, trading cards, and other games like the Super Smash Bros. series. \n \nFrom early 1981 until 1986, Sugimori illustrated a gaming fanzine called Game Freak, which had been started by Satoshi Tajiri. Sugimori discovered the magazine in a dōjinshi shop, and decided to get involved. Eventually, the two decided to pitch an arcade game design idea to Namco; they reworked Game Freak into a development company and produced Mendel Palace. Sugimori is most famous as the character designer and art director for the Pokémon franchise and drew all of the original 151 Pokémon himself. He has worked on the various Pokémon movies, trading cards, and other games. \n \nFor Pokémon Black and White, Sugimori directed a team of 17 people in designing new characters for the games, though he always drew the final designs. He drew much of his inspiration from observing animals in aquariums and zoos. Sugimori has also written and illustrated original manga, including one which was distributed with pre-orders of Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness. When he begins a new character, his process normally involves making a rough sketch, then tracing it on to film paper while polishing it and making the illustration more professional looking. After that, he draws the character many times, changing its proportions until he is satisfied. \n \n(Source: Wikipedia) \n \nTwitter: @SUPER_32X\n  ","name":"Ken Sugimori","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/4825/original.jpg"},{"id":"6850","description":"","name":"Takeshi Nozue","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/6850/original.jpg"},{"id":"5705","description":"","name":"Tatsuya Nishiwaki"},{"id":"21098","description":" Wikipedia","name":"Miguel De Cervantes Saavedra","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/21098/original.jpg"},{"id":"690","description":" \n  Hometown  \n San Francisco, California (born)/Japan (lives) \nSkills &amp; Abilities: English, kendo (first dan) \nBlood type: AB \n \nHe was born in the US, but raised in Kumamoto, Japan, and is married to fellow seiyuu Saki Nakajima. \n \nBlog: http://ameblo.jp/satoshi-hino/\n \n ","name":"Satoshi Hino","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/690/original.jpg"},{"id":"23719","description":"  Haruna Gouzu is a 2011 graduate of the Tokyo branch of Yoyogi Animation Gakuen's animator course.

A Fashionable Judo Girl), a suspenseful human drama about a former mercenary (Pineapple ARMY; story by Kazuya Kudo), a captivating psychological suspense story (Monster), a sci-fi adventure manga (20th Century Boys), and a modern reinterpretation of the work of the God of Manga, Osamu Tezuka (Pluto: Urasawa x Tezuka; co-authored with Takashi Nagasaki, supervised by Macoto Tezka, and with the cooperation of Tezuka Productions). Many of his books have spawned popular animated and live-action TV programs and films, and 2008 saw the theatrical release of the first of three live-action Japanese films based on 20th Century Boys. \n \nNo stranger to accolades and awards, Urasawa is a three-time recipient of the prestigious Shogakukan Manga Award, a two-time recipient of the Osamu Tezuka Cultural Prize, and has received the Kodansha Manga Award.

However, the sound has changed in recent times to take on a darker and more mysterious tone. Takarano Arika, lead singer/lyricist, has termed this change as a transition from White Alice (白アリ) to Black Alice (黒アリ). Though there has been a general shift towards performing songs in the \"Black Alice\" phase, Ali Project has occasionally sung in the White Alice style as well. \n \nThey made their indie debut in the charts in 1988 as Ari (Ant) Project (蟻プロジェクト) with their album <i>Fantastic Garden</i> (幻想庭園 Gensou Teien). The album was later included in Tatsumi Takayuki's book <i>Philosophy of Progressive Rock</i> (プログレッシヴ・ロックの哲学), which led to the band being classified under the progressive rock genre. \n \nFour years later in 1992 they changed their name and made their major debut with their single <i>Fall in love, maiden</i> (恋せよ乙女, Koiseyo Otome). \n \nMost of their records are released by Toshiba-EMI, Victor Entertainment and Tokuma Japan. The band is notable in the anime community for having their songs featured in several anime opening and ending sequences, most notably the series <i>Noir</i> and <i>Rozen Maiden</i>.

They launched their live performance-oriented activities, mainly performing mixture rock full of street sense that passionately renders their enthusiasm for music. Striking out by integrating French-speaking rap into their music, the band rapidly expanded their fan base by word of mouth, performing successful one-band shows even in their early days. And so they made their much-awaited indie debut with “Future,” which marked #2 on Tower Records’ indie chart and #18 on Japan Countdown, attracting attention among music fans. Second indie single “Lapis lazuli,” released in February 2009, won #1 on Tower Records’ indie chart, which was a dream come true. \n \nOn May 27, 2009, DUSTZ released their major debut single “Break &amp; Peace” (ending theme of TV anime Sengoku BASARA). Soon after, they were invited to a French music festival and became the first Japanese band to make a street performance a success, attracting thousands of people. The success continued with the release of second single “Brilliant Day” (used in TV drama Oretachiwa Tenshida! NO ANGEL NO LUCK) on October 7. \n \n2010 saw the departure of the drummer, making DUSTZ a band of three half-Japanese, half-French descent members, namely vocalist Ray, guitarist KenT and bassist Gus. In December that year, they premiered a new key-visual made by three world-renowned creative directors Joji Kojima, Noritaka Tatehana and Koji Shiouchi. Its sensual yet sublime artwork caused sensation in music and fashion industries alike. \n \nOn April 6, 2011, DUSTZ released their much-awaited new single entitled “Criez”, which was their first in a year and a half. With French, English and Japanese languages crisscrossing the tune, its new-generation, hybrid rock sound that no one had ever experienced spread around the globe as the first shout of the renewed DUSTZ. On May 21, DUSTZ announced that they would be making the opening theme of BLOOD-C, a high-profile TV anime famous as the collaborative project of CLAMP and Production I.G. \nVocalist Ray has also been appearing in various topical films and dramas as actor Ray Fujita. He is currently acting in Les Misérables, the 100th anniversary gala of the Imperial Garden Theater. \n \nDustz's first album Trois was released by Epic Records Japan on December 14, 2011 \n \n(source: DUSTZ official website)  ","name":"DUSTZ","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/7393/original.jpg"},{"id":"5362","description":"  Author of the award-winning Haruhi Suzumiya novel series.

As of February 1, 2016, he became a freelance. He also hosted MAG Net between April 2014 to March 2013 with fellow seiyuu Saori Gotou. \n \nTogether with a fellow seiyuu Kamiya Hiroshi, he is the host of 神谷浩史・小野大輔のDear Girl ～Stories～ which is one of the oldest and one of the most prevalent seiyuu-hosted radio programs.  He has hosted various other programs including <i>Ono Daisuke, Kondou Takayuki no Yume Bouken~Dragon&amp;Tiger</i> with seiyuu Takayuki Kondou. \n \nHe formed the air band \"MASOCHISTIC ONO BAND\" with Kamiya Hiroshi that debuted at Nippon Budoukan in 2013, whose personnel consist of the staff of DGS radio program. \n \nHe is part of the \"D.A.T\" singing unit with Kondo Takayuki since 2012; \"D.A.T\" sings in the annual \"Marine Super Wave Live.\" He is the leader of  \"DABA\", a project created in 2008 bringing together Fukuyama Jun, Hino Satoshi, Tachibana Shinnosuke, Suganuma Hisayoshi, Majima Junji and Kondo Takayuki, they are all male voice actors born in 1978. In addition, he is also a part of the singing sub-unit of \"DABA\"; \"CABA\", active since 2014. \n \nHe is the leader and host of the annual OrePara live (founded in 2008), with Suzumura Kenichi, Morikubo Showtaro &amp; Terashima Takuma (replacing Iwata Mitsuo from 2014 onward). \n \nIn DGS radio program, he has admitted that he is not fond of cats because of his unpleasant childhood experience with them. This is quite ironic considering his character in Kuroshitsuji, Sebastian Michaelis, is obsessed with cats. However, it seems that Ono Daisuke has no problem at all with Nyanko-sensei or Nya-san, a cat that belongs to his fellow seiyuu Kamiya Hiroshi. \n \nHe dislikes raisins, but loves Chinese noodles, nuts and almonds. He has a certain fascination in Buddha statue. The first time he saw the biggest Buddha statue in the world was on his birthday celebration in Ushiku-shi, a place he had wanted to visit, which is also Kamiya Hiroshi's hometown. \n \nAwards :  \n2nd Seiyuu Awards (2008) - Best Supporting Actor \n4th Seiyuu Awards (2010) - Best Actor \n9th Seiyuu Awards (2015) - Best Actor &amp; Best Personality \nTokyo Anime Awards (2015) - Best Voice Actor \n \nLantis profile: http://www.lantis.jp/\n  ","name":"Daisuke Ono","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/321/original.jpg"},{"id":"2879","description":" \n  Born  \n Noboru Aikawa \nHometown: Tokyo, Japan \n ","name":"Shou Aikawa","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/2879/original.jpg"},{"id":"7429","description":" Wikipedia, edited","name":"Oasis","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/7429/original.jpg"},{"id":"24767","description":"","name":"Tomonori Kuroda"},{"id":"17889","description":"","name":"Kouichi Yamano","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/17889/original.jpg"},{"id":"26056","description":" ANN","name":"Kou Kojima","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/26056/original.jpg"},{"id":"4338","description":"","name":"Jyukai","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/4338/original.jpg"},{"id":"14566","description":"","name":"Takayuki Mizushina","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/14566/original.jpg"},{"id":"271","description":"","name":"Masayoshi Nishita","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/271/original.jpg"},{"id":"13172","description":"  Hiroyama Hiroshi is also known as \"KALMIA\" and works on Fate/Stay Night doujinshi under that name. \n \nTwitter: @hiroshi_\n  ","name":"Hiroshi Hiroyama","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/13172/original.jpg"},{"id":"34558","description":"","name":"Kousuke Fujii"},{"id":"7635","description":"  Hobby Japan is a Japanese hobby magazine and publishing company, specialising in roleplaying, war, and tabletop games, as well as action figures, toys, and artbooks for successful anime, manga and light novel franchises.

At the age of 15 he moved to Tokyo and began working for a bookbinder. At 17, he made his first manga submission to Shonen Jump, but it was considered by the editors to be too graphic for the weekly magazine's format and was subsequently rejected. Maruo temporarily removed himself from manga until November of 1980 when he made his official debut as a manga artist in Ribon no Kishi at the age of 24. It was at this stage that the young artist was finally able to pursue his artistic vision without such stringent restrictions over the visual content of his work. Two years later, his first stand-alone anthology, Barairo no Kaibutsu (Rose Colored Monster) was published. \n \nMaruo was a frequent contributor to the legendary underground manga magazine Garo. \n \nLike many manga artists, Maruo sometimes makes cameo appearances in his own stories. When photographed, he seldom appears without his trademark sunglasses. \n \nThough most prominently known for his work as a manga artist, Maruo has also produced illustrations for concert posters, CD Jackets, magazines, novels, and various other media. Some of his characters have been made into figures as well. \n \nThough relatively few of Maruo's manga have been published outside of Japan, his work enjoys a cult following abroad. \n \nHis book Shoujo Tsubaki (aka Mr. Arashi's Amazing Freak Show) has been adapted into an animated film by Hiroshi Harada with a soundtrack by J.A. Seazer, but it has received very little release. In Europe it was marketed under the name Midori, after the main character.

In addition to his very popular pilot comics, Shintani has successfully ventured into science fiction, fantasy, comedy, and hentai comics as well. In 1985, he was awarded the Shogakukan Manga Award for shounen for Area 88 and Futari Daka. \n \nShintani began his career in 1972 as a shoujo artist and was nominated for the Ribon Comics Award for best new artist of that year. After working as an assistant to Leiji Matsumoto, the writer and artist of Captain Harlock and Space Battleship Yamato, Shintani began to publish aviator titles in various comic magazines. Serialization of Area 88 began in 1979 and the title has been popular ever since. \n \nWhile working as an assistant to Matsumoto, one of Shintani's duties was to construct plastic models for drawing reference.

She grew up in a single parent family and does not have any memory of her father. She states that she has always been close to music; be it from her mother's car stereo or the radio, she would remember the tunes and sing along. \n \nHer professional career began in March 2004 when, at the recommendation of her juku instructors, she applied for an audition hosted by Sony Music Japan. Despite the audition rule that a participant could only perform two songs, Yui was allowed to sing three. She first sang \"Why Me\" (a song later included in her debut single), followed by \"It's Happy Line\" and \"I Know.\" The judges gave her the maximum score, causing a fierce scramble among record labels to sign her.[citation needed] Because \"I Know\" was incomplete at the time, the judges were able to get a glimpse of what would later be dubbed \"Yui-go,\" or Yui-speak (Yui語 in Japanese), nonsensical English hummed to a tune during her songwriting process—an example of Yui-go can be found in the film Midnight Sun when Yui is working on the song \"Goodbye Days.\" \n \nOn December 24, 2004, she released her debut single \"It's Happy Line\" under indie label Leaflet Records, coupled with the track \"I Know.\" The pressing was limited to only 2,000 copies in her home area. \n \nThe Associated Press has reported that her full name is Yui Yoshioka. \n \nSince May 4, 2013, she is a vocalist of FLOWER FLOWER as yui. \n \nShe is mother of twin boys, who were born on August 9, 2015.

This was the beginning of Otomo's interest in science-fiction themes. In 1980, Otomo's \"Domu\" became a best-seller and won Japan's Science Fiction Grand Prix Award. In 1982, Otomo came up with the comic series \"Akira,\" which was first published in magazine Young. It was an immediate success and grew into an epic tale. It has won numerous awards and is regarded by many as the finest work of graphic fiction ever created.

He used to work for Production Baobab but is now the head of T's Factory, a seiyuu company he founded in 1998. \n \nKoyasu is known for his deep, smooth voice, which often lands him in roles that are either villains or lonely bishōnen. Recently, though (as in the cases of Mitsurugi Hanagata from Saber Marionette J, Ryo Kuroyanagi from Yakitate!! Japan, Bobobo-Bo-Bobobo, and Kei Itoshiki from Zoku Sayonara Zetsubo Sensei) he has been voicing more and more lively/humorous characters. According to Hisaya Nakajo, the mangaka of the series Hana-Kimi, the character of Masao Himejima was designed with Koyasu's voice in mind; the seiyū ended up voicing this character in the series' drama CDs. \n \nKoyasu is also the creator of the Weiß series, and has authored the manga Weiß Side B. In creating Weiß Kreuz, Koyasu was inspired by an old Japanese series called Sure Death. \n \nKoyasu often voices under the pseudonym Hayato Jumonji, especially in H anime. \n \nHe also narrates promotional videos and pre-flight safety videos for StarFlyer. \n \nBlood type: A \nHeight: 175 cm \nWeight: 60 kg \nBust-Waist-Hip: 83-65-93 cm  \n \nFavourites: \nBeverages: milk, brandy \nColours: black, white, blue \nCountry: Egypt \nAnimal: Giraffe \nBrands of clothing: Fila, Donna Karan, Van, Ships \nDate spot: the sea \nMusic group: L'arc~en~Ciel \nTV show: \"trendy\" dramas \nFlower: yellow rose \nFoods: ebi, tofu, men's pocky \nIdol: Mita Hiroko \nSeason: autumn \n \nHobbies: \nSnowboarding \nVideo Games \nWriting \n \nSkills &amp; Abilities: \nBaseball \nDesigning signatures \nE Rank Driver \nJump rope \nPhotography  ","name":"Takehito Koyasu","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/423/original.jpg"},{"id":"3217","description":"","name":"Tooru Okada","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/3217/original.jpg"},{"id":"1773","description":" \n  Birthplace  \n Tokyo, Japan \n \nShe co-hosts an ongoing radio show with fellow seiyuu Kappei Yamaguchi and Sakura Wars creator Ouji Hiroi. \n \nShe is founder and head of her own voice company called Banbina, which she formed after leaving Arts Vision. \n \nWhen she was a high school student, she was an assistant of Jump Broadcasting Station of Weekly Shounen Jump (1988-1996). \n ","name":"Chisa Yokoyama","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/1773/original.jpg"},{"id":"23872","description":"","name":"Teiichi Akashi"},{"id":"31114","description":" \n  Twitter  \n @eveeve_info\n \n ","name":"Hideaki Matsuoka","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/31114/original.jpg"},{"id":"468","description":"  Birth Place: Tokyo, Japan \nBlood Type: B \nHeight: 157cm \nAstrological sign: Aries \nNicknames: Ayachii (あやちー), Ayasumi (あやすみ), Aya-nee (あやねえ) \n \nFavorites: Yakult Swallows (baseball team) \nHobbies: Cooking, Scuba diving, Yoga \nSkills: Playing the Piano  ","name":"Ayako Kawasumi","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/468/original.jpg"},{"id":"22415","description":" \n  Twitter  \n @phatmans_staff \nFacebook: @phatmansafterschool\n \n ","name":"phatmans after school","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/22415/original.jpg"},{"id":"23377","description":"","name":"Ichirou Ogawa"},{"id":"221","description":" \n  Twitter  \n @asakonishida \n ","name":"Asako Nishida","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/221/original.jpg"},{"id":"1257","description":"  Birth place: Sendai, Miyagi Prefecture, Japan \nBlood type: B \nHeight: 162cm \nWeight: 47kg  ","name":"Kanako Tateno","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/1257/original.jpg"},{"id":"7576","description":"  Kazuo is the grandmaster of Japanese horror manga.

After graduation in 1961 he joined Toei Douga, but left it soon after. Since then he has worked for Mushi Production, Zuiyo, Group Tac, and currently resides in Madhouse. \n \nLike many of the figures of this period, Hirata started his career as an animator at Toei Doga as an inbetweener in the features made from 1960 to 1963: Journey to the West, Anju, Sinbad, Little Prince. Specifically, he was under the tutelage of Yasuji Mori. Hirata still speaks extremely highly of the experience and of Mori in particular, going so far as to say that if it hadn't been for Mori, he probably wouldn't be in animation today. Mori was a major influence on Hirata -- as well as many of those who worked with him like Miyazaki and Takahata -- not only because he was a great teacher and animator himself, but also because he was a gentle person who, legend has it, never got angry at anyone. He took animation seriously, and approached it with rigor and love. Mori's legacy is clearly at the root of Hirata's pliant, honest, soulful approach to animation.\n\nOne of the things that is unique about this early period is the variety of origins of the animators. In other words, today people come to anime because they've seen anime; but back then, during the early Toei Doga period, there was no TV anime, so many of the people who entered Toei Doga did so because they had seen a few Disney pics in the theater, or animated ads on TV, or Hakujaden, etc.. Yet other people simply happened to wander in almost by accident, having studied art at school, and maybe having casually seen an animated film or two, but otherwise knowing nothing about animation. Toshio Hirata falls into the latter group.\n\nAnime then was not yet anime; it was a bunch of young people making tentative steps to figure out what they could do with animation. They were blissfully free of the burdensome history that nowadays blinkers many in the anime industry. Thus could we get films like Little Prince &amp; the 8-Headed Dragon and Gulliver's Space Travels that are full of inventive artistic ideas. Hirata was one of the many people just out of art school who happened to find their way to Toei Doga for whatever reason. Together with a lot of those people, he was drawn to the Animation Sannin no Kai during his Toei Doga period, 1960-1963. If he learned the traditional approach to animation at Toei Doga, the experience of seeing those films broadened his understanding of animation and added an artistic side to his approach. The graphically-oriented aspect of his subsequent output can definitively be traced to this experience.\n\nHirata began his Mushi Pro period in 1966 directing episodes of Jungle Taitei immediately after his involvement in Ken the Wolf Boy at Toei Doga in 1965. His experience at Mushi Pro was a fateful one for him, second to his experience at Toei Doga only in chronological order. Interestingly enough, at Mushi Pro he was automatically started out as a key animator, and the very next year, for Jungle Taitei in 1966, he was bumped up to directing! Ironically, when he helped out on Toei Doga's Gulliver around the same time in 1965, he was bumped back to inbetweening. Apparently credit wasn't transferrable between studios. This is basically attributable to the rather unique system at Mushi Pro that reflected Tezuka's creator-based approach. Tasks weren't clear-cut and heirarchically organized the way they were at Toei Doga; people did various things as necessary, and consequently accession to key animation and directing could be absurdly fast (though, really, the reason for the ad-hoc nature of the studio basically comes down to the shortage of staff).\n \n \n(Source: pelleas.net) \n \nDate of death: August 25, 2014  ","name":"Toshio Hirata","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/9090/original.jpg"},{"id":"21422","description":"","name":"Hiroyuki Seshita","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/21422/original.jpg"},{"id":"1672","description":"  A director at studio BONES.

Sugimori drew all of the original 151 Pokémon himself. He has worked on the various Pokémon movies, trading cards, and other games like the Super Smash Bros. series. \n \nFrom early 1981 until 1986, Sugimori illustrated a gaming fanzine called Game Freak, which had been started by Satoshi Tajiri. Sugimori discovered the magazine in a dōjinshi shop, and decided to get involved. Eventually, the two decided to pitch an arcade game design idea to Namco; they reworked Game Freak into a development company and produced Mendel Palace. Sugimori is most famous as the character designer and art director for the Pokémon franchise and drew all of the original 151 Pokémon himself. He has worked on the various Pokémon movies, trading cards, and other games. \n \nFor Pokémon Black and White, Sugimori directed a team of 17 people in designing new characters for the games, though he always drew the final designs. He drew much of his inspiration from observing animals in aquariums and zoos. Sugimori has also written and illustrated original manga, including one which was distributed with pre-orders of Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness. When he begins a new character, his process normally involves making a rough sketch, then tracing it on to film paper while polishing it and making the illustration more professional looking. After that, he draws the character many times, changing its proportions until he is satisfied. \n \n(Source: Wikipedia) \n \nTwitter: @SUPER_32X\n  ","name":"Ken Sugimori","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/4825/original.jpg"},{"id":"6978","description":"  Birth place: Tokyo, Japan \n \nBlog: http://dreamwave-yumeha.cocolog-nifty.com/blog/\n  ","name":"Yumeha Kouda","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/6978/original.jpg"},{"id":"24145","description":"","name":"Ami Tomobuki"},{"id":"22039","description":"","name":"Shigenori Tanabe"},{"id":"950","description":"  Birth place: Wako, Saitama, Japan \nBlood type: B \n \nSushio is an animator.

After spending her childhood in Tokushima and Okayama, Angela moved from Japan to Hawaii at age 15, continuing on to study Political Science at George Washington University in Washington D.C. \n  \nAngela's music started to materialize as a career while she was still in university.  In 2003, Angela Aki returned to Japan, and the 2005 release of her single \"HOME\" marked her major label debut.  Her first album \"HOME\" has become a classic since its release in 2006, with cumulative sales counting over 600,000 units.

This band’s strength and scope is its ability to draw on the cultural duality of music and experience shared between the 5 members. \n \nWorking with Jason Miller (gODHEAD), Markku Lappaleinen (ex. Hoobastank), and Erik Gregory (programming engineer, credited in Linkin Park’s remix album Reanimation) led to the release of 2 EPs A Moment of Truth and Under The Sun. And from their 2nd EP A Moment of Truth, track Beautiful was showcased in the nationally acclaimed film \"Rainbow Song,\" produced by Japanese cinema icon Shunji Iwai (Swallow Tale Butterfly, Picnic, etc.) in 2006. \n \nfade is poised to transfer this momentum to the road again in 2007, and begin touring their new material up and down Japan in the first of a series of high velocity events known as the Decade of Influence Tour. In the interim, the band head back into the studio to record their newest album To Find A Better Tomorrow, mixed by one of the most in-demand mastering engineers Ted Jensen (known for works by P.O.D., Fall Out Boy, Taking Back Sunday, TRAPT, Yellowcard, My Chemical Romance, etc). The album has been released on Aug. 6, 2008. \n \nThe band is now back on the road again to play in venues nationwide, along with their latest release. Concentrating on starring in venues mainly in and around Tokyo and Osaka, fade has also stopped by to play in sponsored events like MINAMI WHEEL 2008 and SUPER DRY B-JAM. \nThis year, fade has participated in SWEET LOVE SHOWER SPRING09, and is scheduled to play in festivals such as RUSH BALL 09 and LOUD PARK 09. Band's participation to play in festivals has also become global, as they were invited to play in ETPFEST 2009 held in Korea, where they shared the stage with KEANE, NINE INCH NAILS, and LimpBizkit. \n \nIn 2011, fade invites Hajime Okano (sound producer known for works with L'Arc-en-Ciel, etc.) for the first time to work for an album. On 4/27, fade releases new 6th EP Kings of Dawn, and a single One Reason, an opening theme for a Japanese animation series \"Deadman Wonderland\".

The even gave me a musical name. Kanon, is actually taken from canon (and also written as ‘sound of flowers’ in Japanese).” ~Wakeshima Kanon \n♥ \n \nWakeshima Kanon [分島 花音] is a Japanese singer and cellist. Produced by Mana(MALICE MIZER～Moi dix Mois), Wakeshima debuted under the DefSTAR Records label on May 28, 2008 with the single \"Still Doll\", the ending theme for the anime adaptation of the manga series Vampire Knight. She also provided the voice for a maid that appears in the eighth episode of the series. Wakeshima's second single \"Suna no Oshiro\" (砂のお城?), released on November 12, 2008, was used as the ending theme for the series' second season (subtitled Guilty). \n \nShe was nominated for a Best Newcomer award for 2008 in the fourth annual Shojo Beat Music Awards, nominees of which are determined by surveying \"record companies, music journalists, music experts, and music fans\". \n \nBefore her birth, Wakeshima's music loving parents wished for her to be a musician. At the age of three, she began learning the cello beginning her entry into the world of music. In junior high school she formed her own ensemble group. At the age of fifteen, she transitioned from her former classical ensembles into playing in the baroque section. Appearing in a variety of recitals and concerts throughout her school years, she began writing her own music and combining singing with her cello playing at the age of sixteen. As she transitioned form junior high school to high school, she began writing her own music and singing. She gave her first vocal performances during a high school festival. \n \nWakeshima auditioned at Sony Music Entertainment as a singer, originally not intending to include her cello playing with her demo tape, but later changing her mind after experimenting with performing with the piano. She became a finalist at the audition, contracting with the Sony subsidiary DefSTAR Records and debuting on May 28, 2008 with her first single, \"Still Doll\". The single was chosen to be used for the ending theme of the first season of the anime adaptation of the manga series Vampire Knight. \n \nShe uses three cellos, one for performing, one for music videos and one for recording. Wakeshima has given each cello a name. The white cello is known as Mikazuki-san which means \"crescent moon.\" This is the cello she is normally seen performing on during live performances. The red cello is known as \"Nanachie-san\" which means wisdom. This is the cello commonly seen in her music videos. According to Wakeshima, Nanachie-san is very hard to play but she manages. Her third cello is a brown cello called \"Yaeharu-san\" which means \"multi-layered spring.\" Yaeharu-san is very special to Wakeshima since it is the cello she had since middle school and is the one she practices on and records with. Currently, she had a new silver cello named \"Momotose\". \n \n*Blood Type: A \n* \n \n* First Song: Twinkle Twinkle Little Star \n* Most Memorable Song: Haydn's Cello Concerto \n* Favorite Cellist: Jacqueline du Pre \n* Favorite Musicians: Emilie Simon, Lily Chou-Chou, Mayumi Kojima \n* Favorite Composers: Claude Debussy, Erik Satie \n* Favorite Painter: Alfons Maria Mucha \n* Favorite Color: Red(mostly), white, gold, sliver \n* Favorite Authors: Mayumi Nagano, Hiroko Taniyama \n* Hobbies: drawing \n* Pets: cat (one brown and one black) \n \nAlbum:  \n \n侵食ドルチェ[Shinshoku Dolce](Corroding Dolce) (2009.02.18) \n \n少女仕掛けのリブレット～LOLITAWORK LIBRETTO～ [Shōjo Jikake no Libretto: Lolitawork Libretto](A Libretto  on What Makes a Girl Work) (2010.07.28-JAPAN; 2010.07.07-EUROPE) \n \n \nDiscography: \nShinshoku Dolce: \n \n1.

This led to a fascination with the machinery that is pervasive throughout much of his anime work.  \n \nOtsuka found employment in the statistics section of the general affairs department of the Yamaguchi prefectural office first. Then, while working, he came up to Tokyo twice by the business trip. At the time, the current-events satirical comics which he contributed to Yamguchi newspaper were adopted, and the work was temporarily serialized. Afterwards, he decides to go to Tokyo to become a political cartoonist. \n \nIn 1956, Otsuka finished the recuperation life and found the newspaper article that the production of the anime movie Hakujaden was decided to Toei. Then, he visited Nihon Douga (=Japan Animation) company that became the basis of inauguration of Toei Animation, and took the test. The people representing the Japanese animation field such as Yasuji Mori at that time received him, and the result of the examination was passing. He was one of the Toei animators involved in experimenting with frame-rate modulation in animation. This experimentation lead to what is commonly called the \"money shot\" style, where more important scenes are animated more fully than others. He practiced animation while going to work, and was finally temporarily employed as one of the first employees of Toei Animation. However, unless they did overtime work after finishing the task twice or more the regular employment group, they were not able to live because the salary of the temporary employment group was a half of the regular employment group. \n \nIn addition he was a mentor to both Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata and worked with them on many of their early projects. Although he had the chance to do the director several times, he refused it. It is because he witnessed that Isao Takahata faced difficulties during the production of Hols: Prince of the Sun. In a documentary about him, he stated that he revered Takahata's ability as the director in Hols. And, he felt that his ability was insufficient by comparison. \n \nŌtsuka is currently running a school for animators in Japan, and recently Studio Ghibli produced a documentary about the animator. \n \nAchievements: \nAnimation Director for The Castle of Cagliostro; Character Design for Moomin, Lupin III, Future Boy Conan &amp; The Castle of Cagliostro.

He co-created the Mario, Donkey Kong, The Legend of Zelda, F-Zero, Pikmin and Nintendogs franchises for Nintendo game consoles, and mostly works on games as a producer. He has also supervised many titles published by Nintendo on behalf of other developers, including Metroid Prime and Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games. \n \nMiyamoto is a world-renowned game designer, and has been called the \"father of modern video games\" and \"the Walt Disney of electronic gaming\" Video games designed by him typically feature refined control-mechanics, intuitive gameplay, simple story lines, and imaginative worlds in which the players are encouraged to discover things by themselves. \n \nEmployed by Nintendo as an artist in 1977, he was given the task of working on one of their first coin-operated arcade games. The resulting title was Radar Scope, which was not as successful in the United States as Nintendo had hoped. Miyamoto later reused the game's hardware and modified it into Donkey Kong, which was a huge success as well as a turning point in video game history. The game's lead character, Mario (then called Jumpman), became an easily recognizable video game character and Nintendo's mascot. Miyamoto quickly became Nintendo's star producer, designing many franchises for the company, most of which are still active. \n \nSource: Wikipedia  ","name":"Shigeru Miyamoto","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/7091/original.jpg"},{"id":"1818","description":" Wikipedia","name":"Hiroyuki Kitakubo","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/1818/original.jpg"},{"id":"22485","description":"","name":"Ayumi Nishihata"},{"id":"355","description":"<p><div class=\"people-informantion-more js-people-informantion-more\">Japanese animator and character designer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso known as T☆ETUYA</div></p>","name":"Tetsuya Takeuchi"},{"id":"3804","description":"","name":"Kazunori Miyake"},{"id":"1309","description":"","name":"Takayuki Hamana","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/1309/original.jpg"},{"id":"3944","description":" \n  Hometown  \n Koumi-cho, Nagano \n \nTwitter: @shinkaimakoto\n \n ","name":"Makoto Shinkai","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/3944/original.jpg"},{"id":"2219","description":"  Masaki Yamada has worked on several animes as an Character designer and Animator, one of the animes being the quite wellknown: \"Appleseed\"  ","name":"Masaki Yamada","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/2219/original.jpg"},{"id":"6204","description":"  Blood type: O \nBirth place: Nara Prefecture, Japan  ","name":"Atsushi Kousaka","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/6204/original.jpg"},{"id":"751","description":" \n  Twitter  \n @shubi0618\n \n ","name":"Yumiko Kobayashi","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/751/original.jpg"},{"id":"2049","description":"","name":"Ryouichi Ooki"},{"id":"4202","description":"  Real name: Kazuhiko Katou (加藤一彦)  ","name":"Monkey Punch","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/4202/original.jpg"},{"id":"1968","description":"","name":"Hiroaki Gouda"},{"id":"24456","description":"","name":"Atsushi Soga"},{"id":"4723","description":" \n  Zodiac  \n Libra \nBirthplace: Choushi, Chiba, Japan \nOne of Japan’s top horror/sci-fi writers.

Before his career in animation ever took off, he was working in a simple government job, and was no more than a fan of anime himself. While attending an anime convention, Nobuteru had the chance to speak with an animator who encouraged him to pursue the field of work, and he decided from that point that he too would be an animator. Nobuteru's first projects would be doujinshi, self-published manga of an amateur level, which he worked on under the pen name The Man In The High Castle. During this time he says he looked to other anime and manga as influence for his work. With his style established and a small name made for himself, he was finally able to secure a position as a part-time animator at Studio Min and DAST, where he worked on Megazone 23. With his foot in the animation industry door, Nobuteru's career grew quickly, with character design role being handed to him in 1989 for the anime movie Five Star Stories. His industry options expanded further to include commissions for video game conceptual design, with 1995 marking his first role as character designer for the Japan-only release of Seiken Densetsu 3 (equivalently: Secret of Mana 2). Gamers probably know him best for the vast number of character designs he provided for Chrono Cross several years later, as well as following titles in the Mana series.

The film became the second highest grossing title of the year 1999 in Japan. Ishii quickly followed his success with another box office hit, Party 7 (2000) which featured Masatoshi Nagase, Yoshio Harada and Tadanobu Asano among others. Between the years 2001-2002, the writer-director created a series of short films including the 3D animated dialogue piece Hal &amp; Bons and the 2D animated space opera Trava Fist Planet. Among other commercials and select TV projects including the short Black Room which starred Takuya Kimura, and Music Power Go Go!, Ishii has also found the time to collaborate with Production I.G for the animation sequence of Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill Vol.1. \n \nIn 2004, his fourth feature film The Taste of Tea won Best Feature Film at the Hawaii International Film Festival. \n \nIn 2006, he co-directed a feature film Funky Forest with Shunichiro Miki and ANIKI who are also Japanese film makers and Ishii's school friends. \n \nHe established his own company called Nice Rainbow in October 2006. \n \n  ","name":"Katsuhito Ishii","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/6473/original.jpg"},{"id":"22161","description":"","name":"Takako Suzuki"},{"id":"23508","description":"","name":"Harumi Tamano"},{"id":"18016","description":"","name":"Yuuko Matsui"},{"id":"1315","description":"  Takashi is a prolific Japanese director noted for directing the Shakugan no Shana and Slayer  ","name":"Takashi Watanabe","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/1315/original.jpg"},{"id":"22452","description":"","name":"Hiroko Satou"},{"id":"1088","description":" \n  Hometown  \n Mie, Japan \nBlood type: B \nHobbies: audio equipments, bowling, Feng Shui, game, skiing \nChronology:  \n(2007-06-01) Changed his given name from 大輔 to だいすけ, pronunciation and romanization remain the same \n \nTwitter: @daisacusacu \nBlog: http://blogs.yahoo.co.jp/daisacusacusacu\n \n ","name":"Daisuke Kishio","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/1088/original.jpg"},{"id":"24742","description":"","name":"Satoko Yamamoto"},{"id":"8003","description":"  Blood type: A \nBirth place: Miyagi Prefecture, Japan \n \nTalent agency: AVEX Planning and Development \n \nTwitter: @Yaskiyo_manager\n  ","name":"Kiyono Yasuno","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/8003/original.jpg"},{"id":"2837","description":"","name":"Kenji Matsumoto"},{"id":"17638","description":"<data><dl>\n<dt><div class=\"people-informantion-more js-people-informantion-more\">Alias</div></dt>\n<dd>Teshikai Utollo<br>\nHeiIs a composer and synthesiser player.

Because of her interest in Russia she is also affectionately known under the nickname Sumipe (すみぺ, the letter R resembles a P in Russia's Cyrillic Alphabet). Other nicknames include Suminya (スミーニャ), because she likes to wear nekomimi accessory, and Gundanchou (軍団長, Corps Commander) because of her interest in military, especially tanks, and her radio show. \n \nAt the age of eight Uesaka was scouted by Space Craft Junior Commercial Talent right when she was going home after an EIKEN Test in Practical English Proficiency. Afterwards she appeared in a Japanese Vidal Sassoon CM. In 2009 she took part in the Web Radio@Dengeki Bunko web radio, where she became a regular between September 2009 and December 2011. During her work there she wanted to breath life into her work, which became one of her inspirations to aspire to become a voice actress. Her other inspiration was voice actress Momoi Haruko, who she respects after she incidentally saw <i>Nurse Witch Komugi-chan Magikarte</i> when she was still a primary school student. Uesaka described the experience as shocking but it was there that she heard Momoi for the first time and yearned to become a voice actress afterwards. In April, 2011 she joined Space Craft Entertainment's anime section. Starting October 7, 2011 she became a radio personality on A&amp;G NEXT GENERATION Lady Go!!. Following an announcement on August 12 of the same year at the Summer Comic Market 80, it was announced that she had being casted on the 2012 TV anime series <i>Papa no Iukoto wo Kikinasai!</i>. In January 2012 she made her debut as voice actress, lending her voice to the heroine Takanashi Sora. Later Matsu Tomohiro, the original author, and Kawasaki Itsurou, the director, said that she was chosen at the audition despite technical flaws, because they couldn't picture anyone else as Sora. Following her first starring role she became gradually more busy during 2012. \n \nUesaka is an avid fan of Russia and its history, culture, military, literature and art. This traces back to the time when she was a tenth grade student, in her first year of high school, and heard by chance for the first time the Soviet Union national anthem. Henceforth she began to develop an interest in Russia and devoted herself to studying about Russian society and history on her own. She couldn't picture herself studying anything other than Russian language at university. In April 2010, she entered the Faculty of Foreign Studies at the well known Sophia University after a recommendation from Kamakura Women's University Junior &amp; Senior High School where she graduated. There she was majoring in Russian Studies. Her graduation thesis was a study of the early history of the Red Army. On July 10, 2012 she received Sophia University's Studies Prize For Excellent Work. \n \nStarting April, 2012 she received her own radio show, the Uesaka Sumire's Armored Guards Infantry Regiment Broadcast on Nico Nico Live. Because of her familiarity with Russia and interest in its military, she was casted as the Russian girl Nonna on TV anime series <i>Girls und Panzer</i> in October 2012. She also sung two Russian insert songs during the show, \"Cossack no Komoriuta\" and \"Katyusha,\" both covers of well known folk songs. Her performance as voice actress and singer received a lot of attention in Japan and overseas thereafter. \n \nUesaka likes to study languages and is, aside of Russian, proficient in English and Chinese as well, having passed several language proficiency tests. She also likes Lolita Fashion and as such became a model for the Baby, The Stars Shine Bright clothing brand. Photo shoots with her are published frequently in Kera, Gothic &amp; Lolita Bible and other well known magazines. She likes to draw and often posts illustrations on her blog and pixiv account. Her favorite food includes lamb chop and Kinoko no Yama. Her favorite politician is Vyacheslav Molotov, her favorite manga and anime characters are Chirico Cuvie, Duke Tougou and Rudolf von Stroheim. Her favorite tank is the BT-5 produced by the Soviet Union. On May 26, 2012 she served as a one-day captain of the JS Yamayuki at the Marine Fiesta in Funabashi. \n \n(Source: AniDB) \n \nTwitter: @uesaka_official\n  ","name":"Sumire Uesaka","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/8362/original.jpg"},{"id":"26567","description":"","name":"Takehiro Nakayama"},{"id":"8722","description":" \n  Gender  \n Male \nBirthplace: Japan \n ","name":"Hanaharu Naruko","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/8722/original.jpg"},{"id":"5545","description":"","name":"Matsuzawa Mari"},{"id":"3662","description":"  Birth place: Tokyo, Japan \n \nREMI is a female singer who is a member of Sound Horizon and often works on Yasuharu Takanashi's soundtracks. \n \nBlog: http://blog.goo.ne.jp/remi117\n  ","name":"REMI","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/3662/original.jpg"},{"id":"2269","description":" \n  Twitter  \n @nabe_atsu_live\n \n ","name":"Atsuko Watanabe","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/2269/original.jpg"},{"id":"5646","description":" Wikipedia","name":"Kenji Miyazawa","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/5646/original.jpg"},{"id":"18961","description":"","name":"Kaya Urakawa"},{"id":"9207","description":"  KAmiYU is a seiyuu unit formed under Kiramune Label, Lantis.

But Miyazaki did show up, and was impressed enough to not only buy a painting (Upward Draft, now hanging in the staff cafeteria at Studio Ghibli) but to also invite Inoue to join the art team then being assembled for Miyazaki's production of Whisper of the Heart, being directed by Yoshifumi Kondou. Several of Inoue's Iblard  paintings were used during the Miyazaki-directed CGI fantasy sequence in the film, in which we get to see a couple of scenes from Shizuku's first novel, The Story Baron Gave Me. \nInoue also voiced one of the musician characters in the film - he's the one that compliments Shizuku's \"nice vocal\" after their impromptu performance of Country Roads.

Their early albums were marked by a distinct world influence, with works such as Chi no Hibiki (Echoes of the Earth Sing East Europe) displaying Bulgarian and other eastern European singing styles and Africa Genjoh (The African Vision Singing) featuring African stylised chanting. Osore-zan - Dounokenbai, furthermore, offered a more psychedelic flavor with Krautrock influences and the introduction of guitar work. \n \nTheir breakthrough however came in the 1980s. MIDI digital synthesizers could not handle the tuning systems of traditional gamelan music, so the group had to start from scratch, teaching themselves how to program in order to modify their equipment. The album that followed, Ecophony Rinne (1986) was a new direction for the group, the first time they incorporated computer generated sounds into their work. It also marked the start of what’s now known as the “trilogy”.  The success of this album brought them to the attention of Katsuhiro Otomo, who commissioned them to create what would become their most well-known work, the soundtrack of Akira. Ecophony Gaia, released in 1990, is the third album of the “trilogy” - Ecophony Rinne (1986) and AKIRA (1990) make up the respective first and second albums in the trilogy - and like Akira before it revels in experimentation, with traditional musical styles and modern instrumentation and synthesizers being used to create a wonderful fusion of styles that become almost impossible to clearly categorize. \n \nGeinoh Yamashirogumi has faithfully and accurately reproduced over eighty different styles of traditional music and performances from around the world, but despite having performed internationally to a high degree of critical acclaim they remain relatively unknown. \n \n(source: wikipedia)  ","name":"Geinoh Yamashirogumi","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/1815/original.jpg"},{"id":"22624","description":"  Luck Life is a band which began its activities formally in 2008.

He sensitively supports the sound of Choro Club from below. \n \nThe acoustic string trio Choro Club was formed in 1989 by three musicians, each with his own distinctive character and musical aspirations. They recorded their first album in 1990. The group’s name is taken from the choro, a style of instrumental music with its origins in Rio de Janeiro. While generating the mood of the choro, they create a musical world sometimes intense and sometimes sentimental, through the exercise of their highly original collective sensibility. Almost all the numbers on their previous １８ albums were composed by the members of the trio themselves. \n \nIt isn’t possible to assign the music of Choro Club to any standard category. That’s because the sound created by these three musicians is truly unique. \n \nOver the past decade Choro Club have performed not only in standard concert halls and clubs but also in a wide variety of venues including classical concert halls, art museums, galleries, aquariums, botanical gardens, Shinto shrines, beer breweries and various other open-air locations, and at jazz festivals. \n \nThe music of Choro Club has been highly praised for its creativity even in Brazil, the country of origin of the choro. They recorded their third album in 1992 in Rio de Janeiro, and a solo open-air concert they gave on that occasion, organized by the Department of Tourism of the City of Rio de Janeiro, was attended by as many as 3,000 people and was given prominent coverage, along with the scene of recording, by localnewspapers and TV and radio broadcasts. In 1995, Choro Club was sponsored by the Japan Foundation on a concert tour of six Latin American countries including Brazil. \n \nSubsequently, in 2003, they collaborated with Tomi Taira, a well-known actress from Okinawa, on an original musical play \"NIRAIKANAI\", at Sao Paulo, Brazil. \n \nChoro Club has released 3 albums in 2005 - \"PREVENDO\" from King records, then the soundtrack for \"ARIA\", the popular Japanese TV animation, released by Victor Entertainment, and their greatest hits album \"REVENDO\" from BMG, which includes a selection of their works from 1990 to 1994. And in 2006&amp;2008,released 2 more soundtracks for \"ARIA\"series. \n \nIn 2009, just released their latest album \" Trilogia\" from VideoArts Music Inc. \nChoro Club have established their own unprecedented and unique sound for 20 years they have been working together. \n \nThe members of Choro Club strive to achieve not only a high degree of musical sophistication but also a truly adult sense of relaxation and pleasure. Their music continues to offer universal potential. \n \nSource: \nhttp://www.players.ne.jp/~choro/prof-e.html\n \n ","name":"Choro Club","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/4648/original.jpg"},{"id":"21693","description":"","name":"Tetsuo Ichimura"},{"id":"8149","description":"","name":"Toshiya Oono","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/8149/original.jpg"},{"id":"18430","description":" AniDB","name":"Lewis Carroll","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/18430/original.jpg"},{"id":"8148","description":"","name":"Akira"},{"id":"34194","description":"","name":"Tadashi Kitaoka"},{"id":"27723","description":"","name":"Sarasa Ifu","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/27723/original.jpg"},{"id":"26875","description":"","name":"Kousuke Sameshima"},{"id":"18064","description":"","name":"Torao Arai"},{"id":"9062","description":" \n  Female \n \nTwitter  \n @mielelatte\n \n ","name":"Utako Yukihiro","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/9062/original.jpg"},{"id":"31347","description":"  Miyo Sato, born in Aichi, Japan, 1989, graduated from Nagoya University of Arts, Department of Media Arts in 2011 and Tokyo University of the Arts, Graduate School of Film and New Media, Department of Animation in 2015.

Her blood type is B, and she is married to fellow mangaka Tatsuneko. She is a graduate of Mita Senior High School, Tokyo. She currently lives in Setagaya-ku, Tokyo, and also has a daughter. \n \nShe began her career as a doujinshi artist creating doujinshi for works such as Saint Seiya, Captain Tsubasa and Maouden. \n \nShe debuted in a commercial magazine with the original work Metal Heart (serialised in Kobunsha's Comic VAL from November 1986). After her debut, she continued to contribute on numerous doujin works. However, the later disbanding of a doujin circle, Yajou Teikoku, she had founded with Maki Chikura, led to her taking numerous breaks from her commercial works. Due to this, there were incomplete works penned by her during this period. \n \nDuring her years in middle school, she had been a fan of Masami Kurumada's manga series Ring ni Kakero, Fuuma no Kojirou, Saint Seiya and B't X (serialised in Weekly Shounen Jump), sending Kurumada numerous fan letters asking to meet him, after which Kurumada finally agreed, inviting her to his workplace. \n \nWhen asked about her penname in an interview in the September 2006 issue of Puff, she responded that she had originally thought of making it Kouga Jun, but subsequently changed it to Kouga Yun. \n \nAmong her noted works is Loveless, which has been serialised in Monthly Comic Zero Sum since 2002 and is ongoing, as well as her work Tenshichou (天使庁). She has also worked as an illustrator on the noted literary magazine Faust. \n \nIn 2007, she contributed the character designs to the Sunrise anime series, Mobile Suit Gundam 00. \n \n(Source: AniDB) \n \nTwitter: @yunk99 \nBlog: http://yunkouga.jugem.jp/\n  ","name":"Yun Kouga","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/3091/original.jpg"},{"id":"23632","description":"","name":"Isako Higashino"},{"id":"12292","description":" \n  Twitter  \n @nekogaeru \npixiv: #112311\n \n ","name":"Satoshi Mizukami","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/12292/original.jpg"},{"id":"22246","description":"","name":"Tetsutarou Furuichi"},{"id":"4605","description":"  BUMP OF CHICKEN is a Japanese rock band consisting of four members.

She committed suicide on May 10, 1998. At the time, the media suggested that it was a reaction to the death on May 2, 1998 of the musician hide—in response to that theory, Nekojiru's husband, Yamano Hajime, said that Nekojiru's musical taste was in a completely different genre to hide, and that her death was unrelated. He stated that \"She probably hasn't listened to even one second of hide's music.\" Without a suicide note, her motivation for suicide remains unclear. Other suggestions include that it was caused by drug use or anxiety over Yamano's womanizing. \n \nWith the exception of Tsunami, all Nekojiru's work has main characters drawn as cats. Even in her manga essays, <i>Jirujiru Travel Journal</i> and <i>Jirujiru Diary</i>, she drew herself as a cat. But though the characters appear as animals, the artist chose as her setting not a forest, but rather the human world. Her manga detailing the daily life and adventures of the cats Nyāko and Nyatta are held in high esteem. The major themes of her work are a child-like zaniness, cruelty and nostalgia. And, as we know from Dream Memo, included in the posthumously released compilation <i>Nekojiru Udon 3</i>, many of her bizarre works of fantasy were based on her own dream experiences. Psychedelic mushrooms and LSD also often appear in her works. \n \nYamano Hajime, using the pen-name Nekojiru-y, took over Nekojiru's world, and continues to produce new works. Currently on his official site, one can read a free chapter of Nekojiru's manga.

Her father was a big fan of classical and opera music and always desired for Yuki to play the piano for him.  Yuki eventually gained a love for music and a love for the piano. \n \nYuki started out as an SE programmer, but changed to music in 1992.  She made her grand debut with a female trio called \"See-Saw.\"  In the years to come the group released six singles and two albums. \n \nYuki then went on to work on her solo career composing for artists and some TV, films, and games, such as Blood: The Last Vampire in 2001, and Xenosaga II and III.   \n \nIn 2001 Yuki's claim to fame came with the release of the anime \"NOIR.\"  The soundtrack sold 50,000 copies.  In 2002 she was brought on to project .hack to write the score to .hack//SIGN, along with volcalist Chiaki Ishikawa and  \nNew York singer Emily Bindiger.   Shortly after Yuki comprised an album of original and complied songs known as Fiction, working again with Emily Bindiger as well as Xenosaga vocalist Deb Lyons. \n \nYuki's other well known works were for Mobile Suite Gundam  Seed, which hit 5th on the Oricon Charts its first week, and selling over 200,000 copies.  \n \nYuki has also become known for her work on CLAMP's Tsubasa Chronicle series movie and OAV's. \n \nIn 2007, Yuki formed the band Kalafina, with two partners from the FictionJunction project, Wakana Ōtaki and Keiko Kubota, mainly to perform for the anime Kara no Kyōkai; but the band continues active as of this writing. \n \nTwitter: @fion0806\n \n ","name":"Yuki Kajiura","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/1846/original.jpg"},{"id":"3345","description":"","name":"Tomoyasu Kurashima"},{"id":"9607","description":"  Blood type: O \nBirthplace: Tokyo, Japan \n \nTwitter: @ozanari1134 \nProfile: imenterprise.jp/data.ph...\n  ","name":"Ari Ozawa","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/9607/original.jpg"},{"id":"21514","description":"","name":"Katsunori Hara"},{"id":"1383","description":"","name":"Kentarou Akiyama"},{"id":"18434","description":"<data><dl>\n<dt><div class=\"people-informantion-more js-people-informantion-more\">Twitter</div></dt>\n<dd>@isandenki726</dd>\n</dl></data>","name":"Ai"},{"id":"8319","description":"  Birth place: Sendai, Miyagi Prefecture, Japan  ","name":"Miho Arakawa","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/8319/original.jpg"},{"id":"5894","description":"  Blood type: A \nBirth place: Meguro, Tokyo  ","name":"Masato Shimon","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/5894/original.jpg"},{"id":"8362","description":"  Birth place: Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan \nBlood type: O \n \nUesaka Sumire is a voice actress currently affiliated with Space Craft Entertainment. Because of her interest in Russia she is also affectionately known under the nickname Sumipe (すみぺ, the letter R resembles a P in Russia's Cyrillic Alphabet). Other nicknames include Suminya (スミーニャ), because she likes to wear nekomimi accessory, and Gundanchou (軍団長, Corps Commander) because of her interest in military, especially tanks, and her radio show. \n \nAt the age of eight Uesaka was scouted by Space Craft Junior Commercial Talent right when she was going home after an EIKEN Test in Practical English Proficiency. Afterwards she appeared in a Japanese Vidal Sassoon CM. In 2009 she took part in the Web Radio@Dengeki Bunko web radio, where she became a regular between September 2009 and December 2011. During her work there she wanted to breath life into her work, which became one of her inspirations to aspire to become a voice actress. Her other inspiration was voice actress Momoi Haruko, who she respects after she incidentally saw <i>Nurse Witch Komugi-chan Magikarte</i> when she was still a primary school student. Uesaka described the experience as shocking but it was there that she heard Momoi for the first time and yearned to become a voice actress afterwards. In April, 2011 she joined Space Craft Entertainment's anime section. Starting October 7, 2011 she became a radio personality on A&amp;G NEXT GENERATION Lady Go!!. Following an announcement on August 12 of the same year at the Summer Comic Market 80, it was announced that she had being casted on the 2012 TV anime series <i>Papa no Iukoto wo Kikinasai!</i>. In January 2012 she made her debut as voice actress, lending her voice to the heroine Takanashi Sora. Later Matsu Tomohiro, the original author, and Kawasaki Itsurou, the director, said that she was chosen at the audition despite technical flaws, because they couldn't picture anyone else as Sora. Following her first starring role she became gradually more busy during 2012. \n \nUesaka is an avid fan of Russia and its history, culture, military, literature and art. This traces back to the time when she was a tenth grade student, in her first year of high school, and heard by chance for the first time the Soviet Union national anthem. Henceforth she began to develop an interest in Russia and devoted herself to studying about Russian society and history on her own. She couldn't picture herself studying anything other than Russian language at university. In April 2010, she entered the Faculty of Foreign Studies at the well known Sophia University after a recommendation from Kamakura Women's University Junior &amp; Senior High School where she graduated. There she was majoring in Russian Studies. Her graduation thesis was a study of the early history of the Red Army. On July 10, 2012 she received Sophia University's Studies Prize For Excellent Work. \n \nStarting April, 2012 she received her own radio show, the Uesaka Sumire's Armored Guards Infantry Regiment Broadcast on Nico Nico Live. Because of her familiarity with Russia and interest in its military, she was casted as the Russian girl Nonna on TV anime series <i>Girls und Panzer</i> in October 2012. She also sung two Russian insert songs during the show, \"Cossack no Komoriuta\" and \"Katyusha,\" both covers of well known folk songs.
