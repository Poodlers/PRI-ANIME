She is also a member of the band Kurobara Hozonkai, with the name Yuiel. Her hobbies include shoulder massage, reading and cooking. \n \nAs a child, she was a huge fan of the anime series <i>Dirty Pair</i> and has later stated that the series was her first inspiration to become a voice artist. \n \nShe debuted in 1997 in a video game <i>Voice Fantasia</i> and for several years had minor roles in various anime. She landed her first leading role as Haruka in <i>Kurogane Communication</i>. The turning point in her career wasn't till the year 2000, when she won the role of Narusegawa Naru in the popular anime <i>Love Hina</i>. Other notable and defining career moments were taking the role of Honda Tooru in the anime <i>Fruits Basket</i> in 2001, and releasing her 1st music album (<i>Mizutamari ni Utsuru Sekai</i>) in 2000. She has since become one of the most popular anime voice actresses in Japan. \n \nHorie formed a temporary unit called Yamato Nadeshiko with the popular seiyuu Tamura Yukari in 2001. They released two singles, <i>Mou Hitori no Watashi</i> and <i>Merry Merrily</i>—the latter of which was an insert song in the <i>Love Hina Christmas Special: Silent Eve</i>. \n \nIn October, 2005 she founded Aice⁵, a J-Pop group consisting of 4 other seiyuu, to help launch their careers. Aice⁵ was officially disbanded on September 20, 2007. \n \nShe has collaborated with a few other artists, such as Unscandal in 2005 and Kurobara Hozonkai, a Japanese Goth band, in 2007. \n \nShe was employed by Arts Vision until mid-2007 due to a scandal within the agency's top management, at which point she left to become a freelance seiyuu unaffiliated with any talent management firm. \n \nShe has published 6 independent musical albums. Nearly all of them incorporate at least one track from an anime she has worked with. She currently releases music under the Starchild label (a subdivision of King Records). \n \n(Source: AniDB) \n \nA member of Aice⁵ with: \n- Akemi Kanda (神田 朱未) \n- Chiaki Takahashi (たかはし 智秋) \n- Masumi Asano (浅野 真澄) \n- Madoka Kimura (木村 まどか) \n \nTwitter (staff): @horieyui_staff \nYoutube: @YuiHorieJP \nInstagram: @yuihorie_official \nBlog: http://ameblo.jp/horieyui-blog/\n  ","name":"Yui Horie","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/1395/original.jpg"},{"id":"26978","description":"","name":"Osmar Santucho"},{"id":"25930","description":"  Blood type: B \nBirth place: Kyoto Prefecture, Japan  ","name":"Yoshihisa Hosokawa","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/25930/original.jpg"},{"id":"5889","description":"","name":"Michael McGhee"},{"id":"4875","description":"","name":"Sharon Shachal","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/4875/original.jpg"},{"id":"23912","description":"","name":"Frédéric Bouraly","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/23912/original.jpg"},{"id":"33314","description":"","name":"Ana Orra","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/33314/original.jpg"},{"id":"794","description":"  Israeli dubber, singer, musician and director. preformed with a band- \"Asaf Avidan &amp; The Mojo's\" until 2011.

Welker (born March 12, 1946) is an American voice actor. He is responsible for a broad spectrum of character voices, noises, and other vocal effects that have appeared over the last 40 years in American television and motion pictures. He is listed as the number one \"All Time Top 100 Stars at the Box office\" in terms of the total revenue his films have generated. His work in over 90 films has put him ahead of Harrison Ford, Tom Hanks and Samuel L. Jackson. \n \nn the 1980s, Welker voiced Megatron, Soundwave and his cassettes, the Dinobot Sludge, and Galvatron in place of Leonard Nimoy (Season 3) in the Transformers cartoon. In this he formed a team with Chris Latta, who voiced Starscream, Megatron's second-in-command. In 1988, Welker did the voice of Rulon leader Krulos in the TV-series Dino-riders. In this cartoon he again formed a team with Chris Latta, who (coincidentally?) voiced Rasp, Krulos' second-in-command. In G.I. Joe, Welker also teamed with Latta. (Other actors who featured in Transformers, Dino-riders and G.I. Joe are Jack Angel, Charlie Adler and Peter Cullen.)

He was suspended twice during that time, once for smoking and once for cheating on a test. Atushi was also a member of a band before becoming interested in comedy. For his first comic act, Atsushi teamed up with a classmate from school. They called themselves Umaseki Fugutarou and Fugunosuke, a name they derived from Shimonoseki, and fugu or pufferfish, a dish famous in the region. Atsushi eventually teamed up with Ryo Tamura after relocating to Tokyo. They chose to go by “London Boots” initially because it was the name of a fictional comedy team who themselves took it after some high-heeled shoes. While “London Boots” does not have any particular meaning in English, in Japanese it refers to the knee length platform shoes worn by some Japanese girls. \nRecently he's being the vocalist of the band jealkb.

He has an EroGuro book out that is mostly a compilation of some of the work he has created. His favourite bands are Queen, Black Sabbath and Jittarin Jin. \n \nArt Style: \nHe has a good understanding of anatomy that allows him to create uniquely expressive poses and angles. His use of accurately detailed shots of hands and feet makes them almost as reflective of character and mood as his faces. Atmospheric backgrounds and landscapes round out the look of the manga, which incorporates many panels done in a finished, shaded pencil style rather than in inked line art. His superb drawing skills are shown to their best advantage in these penciled panels. This applies to most of the manga and artwork he has created. He doesn't seem to use pencils as much as he used to though, preferring a sketchy ink style instead. \n \nEducation: \nSamura says that he always wanted to be a manga artist. However, unlike most mangaka, he attended art school for a time and has a classical art education. He disliked oil painting and prefers to work in black and white. He says that he disliked oil painting from the start because of the smell of the paint and employed someone to help himself cheat to get through the course, which he is quite open about in interviews. He never completed the course because he got picked up by Afternoon before he graduated to do Blade of the Immortal.

Bloom had an early interest in acting, including appearing in several commercials as a child, but made his big break in the Sergio Leone film Once Upon a Time in America. From there, he was offered the role of Dusty Donovan in the hit soap opera As the World Turns, which he played for several years. During that run, Bloom became the youngest winner of a Daytime Emmy Award in the category of Outstanding Young Leading Man during the 12th Daytime Emmy Awards show for his performance on the series. Despite his success, he soon grew tired of the scheduling involved in that field and eventually left the series to star in several television movies and myriad guest appearances. \n \nAfter leaving the soap opera, Bloom starred in several made-for-television films with teen subjects, including Crash Course (1988), Dance 'til Dawn (1988) and Desperate for Love (1989). This opened his appeal to later roles, which would include spots in Melrose Place, 2000 Malibu Road, CSI: Miami, Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit, Drive and HBO's Oz. He played the role of fanatical cult leader Jonas Sparrow in the Joss Whedon show Dollhouse. Bloom also starred in a series of 1994 television movies playing Bandit, a part loosely based on the iconic Burt Reynolds role. Bloom continues his working relationship with Carnahan, playing private mercenary bad guy \"Pike\" in the 2010 movie The A-Team, which Bloom also co-wrote with Carnahan, who directed the 20th Century Fox feature based on the popular television series. \n \nBloom is expanding his resume to include voice work, both acting in animated projects and video games as well as commercial voiceovers. His recent work has been a series of commercials for the 2009 Cadillac Escalade Hybrid, directed by filmmaker Joe Carnahan, the voice of Alex Shepherd in Silent Hill: Homecoming, Kane in Kane &amp; Lynch: Dead Men and its sequel, Kane &amp; Lynch 2: Dog Days, and the voice of Jackie Estacado in The Darkness II. He voiced Captain America in the animated show The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes and the video games Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds, Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 and Marvel Heroes. He voiced William \"B.J.\" Blazkowicz in Wolfenstein: The New Order and Wolfenstein: The Old Blood. He has also voiced a number of characters for BioWare video games, most notably the dwarf storyteller Varric Tethras in Dragon Age II (2011) and its sequel Dragon Age: Inquisition (2014). \n \nHis hobbies include writing, cooking, and designing and building furniture. He owns and runs an online store called Animal World Network. Bloom practices a rare martial art known as bojuka.

In 1987, he moved with his family to South Plainfield, New Jersey, where Gomez attended school. Upon graduation from South Plainfield High School, Gomez moved to New York City to pursue acting. \n \nFollowing a small role in feature film Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, he landed the recurring role of \"Endless Mike\", a quietly crazed, melodramatic high school student in the surreal children's series The Adventures of Pete and Pete, filmed in New Jersey. His highly original performance was singled out for praise by series creators Will McRobb and Chris Viscardi on the series' DVD audio commentary. \n \nGomez went on to appear in small roles in many TV series, telefilms and feature films. (See Filmography, below). Additionally, he co-wrote, with director Damon Santostefano, and starred in the documentary-like feature — or possibly dramatized documentary — Last Man Running (unreleased; made 2003), which also starred wife Jenifer Wymore-Gomez, brother Joshua Gomez, and other New York City film professionals as themselves; it was screened at the Phoenix Film Festival and possibly elsewhere. Gomez was previously executive producer of A Waiter Tomorrow (1998), directed and co-written by Korean-American filmmaker Michael Kang (who appears as himself in Last Man Running). \n \nGomez is also an established voice actor whose credits include the video game Call of Duty 2: Big Red One, the character Gippal in the English dub of Final Fantasy X-2, the character of Zack in Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII and a minor role as the voice of a pilot in The Animatrix. He recently had a cameo in Transformers, playing a Sheriff who attempts to apprehend the protagonist. He and his wife have two sons. \n \n(Source: Wikipedia) \n \nTwitter: @TheRickGomez\n  ","name":"Rick Gomez","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/6561/original.jpg"},{"id":"8530","description":"  Birth place: Iwate Prefecture, Japan \n \nTwitter: @teruiharuka \nProfile: aoni.co.jp/actress/ta/t...\n  ","name":"Haruka Terui","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/8530/original.jpg"},{"id":"25284","description":"  Blood type: O \nBirth place: Saitama Prefecture, Japan \n \nTwitter: @satoyugodesu \nProfile: @satoyugo\n  ","name":"Yuugo Satou","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/25284/original.jpg"},{"id":"33241","description":"","name":"Butz Combrinck"},{"id":"23315","description":"","name":"Peter Cugno"},{"id":"2451","description":"  Ross Douglas is a voice actor with Ocean Studios and has done voices on several shows including Black Lagoon,  InuYasha, and Mobile Suit Gundam  ","name":"Ross Douglas","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/2451/original.jpg"},{"id":"9388","description":"","name":"Grégory Laisné","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/9388/original.jpg"},{"id":"22448","description":" \n  Birthname  \n Michael Robert-Wightman McCarty \nBirthplace: Hollywood, CA, USA \nHeight: 6' 3\" (190cm) \n \nStepson of Edward D.

Her typical look during this time was skin-tight spandex clothing, with her blonde hair in pigtails tied off with pink bows. \n \nSmile hosted Sci-Fi Channel's Anime Week in the summer of 1998. Other notable projects included a self-published comic book featuring herself as the central character and the voice of Ulala in the Space Channel 5 video game series. \n \nIn more recent years, Apollo Smile has seemingly moved away from the \"anime girl\" role she created for herself, seeking small but more conventional film and television roles. She also toured for a short while with the Virginia \"Atari\" band Rockbot. \n \nShe is currently listed among the staff at The Dance Corner dancing school in Killingworth, Connecticut.

When he was six years old he took his first bow on stage with his father's community theater group, The Kensington-Garrett Players in Maryland. It wasn't until his senior year in high school, though, while playing Tevye in Fiddler on the Roof that he concluded that acting was his true vocation. \n \nFollowing professional engagements with a touring company and several other theaters in the Washington D.C. area, he was accepted into the acting program at Adelphi University in 1980. After winning the Alexander-Barnes Acting Competition he was awarded a full scholarship for each of his four years. \n \nEven as a freshman Mercer performed on the Senior Mainstage in plays ranging from Rodgers and Hammerstein to Shakespeare. His repertoire included French mime, dramatic verse, musicals, contemporary comedy, straight plays and cabaret. \n \nMercer trained for three years at the Royal Shakespeare Company at The Guildhall School of Music and Drama in Central London under the tutelage of Cicely Berry, Patsy Rodenberg, Sue Lefton and other stellar lights of the British stage. A highlight was being selected to perform in the British premiere of Leonard Bernstein's Mass under Bernstein's direction. \n \nBefore leaving Great Britain, Mercer had performed professionally with the Royal Shakespeare Company, appeared as \"Mercutio\" at the Arundel Festival and throughout Europe on an Arts Council Tour, led an English cast through the premiere of Yuri Trifonov's The Exchange outside what was then the Iron Curtain, and directed Insignificance for the Edinburgh Festival. \n \nMercer returned to the United States and began teaching acting, improvisation, stage combat, and verse. Mercer's wife Paula Tiso is credited with bringing him to California where he quickly gained his Screen Actors Guild credentials. In addition to his classical and dramatic endeavors, Mercer is in great demand for voice-overs and is part of a comedy troupe that performs regularly at Los Angeles night spots. \n \nTwitter: @FalderalPaul\n  ","name":"Paul Mercier","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/1940/original.jpg"},{"id":"26423","description":" IMDB","name":"Frankie Sakai","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/26423/original.jpg"},{"id":"3214","description":"","name":"Dana Schultes","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/3214/original.jpg"},{"id":"9479","description":"<p><div class=\"people-informantion-more js-people-informantion-more\">French voice actor.</div></p>","name":"Marc Bretonnière"},{"id":"230","description":"  Birth name: Teruhisa Tsuyusaki (露崎 照久) \nHometown: Tokyo, Japan \nBlood type: B  ","name":"Hiro Yuuki","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/230/original.jpg"},{"id":"3057","description":"  1979 KBS Voice Actor In korea  ","name":"Eun Jeong Im","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/3057/original.jpg"},{"id":"8363","description":" \n  Birthplace  \n Tokyo, Japan \n \nSakura Nakamura joined the seiyuu and acting training school of the Atomic Monkey talent agency in 2005.

Her mother a homemaker and her father a pajama factory owner, Miller's professional acting career began on Broadway, where she appeared as Amaryllis in a revival of The Music Man with Dick Van Dyke. \n \nIn 1981, after her appearance on Broadway, she joined the cast of Gimme a Break!, playing the role of the tomboyish Samantha (Sam) Kanisky, opposite Nell Carter. \n \nWhen the series ended its six year run on NBC in 1987, Miller returned east, graduating Phi Beta Kappa and magna cum laude from New York University, where she also played on the university's women's varsity tennis team and continued to perform on stages around the country. Four years later, she graduated from Fordham University School of Law, leaving graduation early to portray Peter Pan in a production at the Pennsylvania Youth Theater in Pennsylvania. She subsequently obtained her Bar association license to practice law in New Jersey, New York and her native Pennsylvania. \n \nIn 1999, Miller returned to Hollywood, California and resumed her on-camera acting career with recurring roles on the Nickelodeon series The Amanda Show and All That, as well as General Hospital. She also began working in animated series, lending her voice to characters such as Kari in Digimon (both the series and the feature film), Koko in Zatch Bell!, Alejo in Astro Boy, one of the Tachikoma mini-tanks in Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, and Scheris Adjani in s-CRY-ed. Miller also provided the singing voice of Dorothy Gale in the NPR adaptation of L. Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. \n \nCurrently (as of 2006), in addition to the recurring roles of Pookie, Wiki and Tini on Disney Channel's Higglytown Heroes, Heruka of Daigunder, and regular guest-starring roles on several other animated series, Miller portrays the title characters on Cartoon Network's The Life and Times of Juniper Lee, and Clifford's Puppy Days on PBS. She also stars in a new series for Nickelodeon's Nick Jr, titled Wow! Wow! Wubbzy! in the role of Widget, the show's problem solver. She also appears on Nick's Zoey 101 live-action series.

Born in Bexar County, Texas on July 12, 1978, Michelle always knew she was destined to become a star, she just didn't know how to get there. Michelle lived in Texas until the age of 8 when her family moved to the Dominican Republic where she lived for two years before moving to Puerto Rico. At 11, Michelle's family relocated for the last time to Jersey City, New Jersey. Although she has been working since 1999 as an extra in such films as Summer of Sam (1999) and Cradle Will Rock (1999), it only took a magazine ad announcing an open casting call in New York for Michelle to decide to finally step into the spotlight. The role was the female lead, the movie was Girlfight (2000). Despite the lack of experience in film and boxing, Michelle auditioned, along with another 350 girls. After various trials inside an actual boxing ring and five arduous months of training in Brooklyn's Gleason's Gym, she was finally chosen to portray the role of Diana Guzman. As soon as the independent film began making the rounds at various film festivals, Michelle began gaining critical acclaim for her performance earning her awards like the Deaxville Festival of American Cinema award for Best Actress and the Las Vegas Film Critics Society for Female Breakthrough Performance. As Girlfight (2000) continued to gain notoriety with its September 2000 release, Michelle was already hard at work with films like 3 A.M. (2001), the blockbuster hit The Fast and the Furious (2001), and Resident Evil (2002).

Because of her interest in Russia she is also affectionately known under the nickname Sumipe (すみぺ, the letter R resembles a P in Russia's Cyrillic Alphabet). Other nicknames include Suminya (スミーニャ), because she likes to wear nekomimi accessory, and Gundanchou (軍団長, Corps Commander) because of her interest in military, especially tanks, and her radio show. \n \nAt the age of eight Uesaka was scouted by Space Craft Junior Commercial Talent right when she was going home after an EIKEN Test in Practical English Proficiency. Afterwards she appeared in a Japanese Vidal Sassoon CM. In 2009 she took part in the Web Radio@Dengeki Bunko web radio, where she became a regular between September 2009 and December 2011. During her work there she wanted to breath life into her work, which became one of her inspirations to aspire to become a voice actress. Her other inspiration was voice actress Momoi Haruko, who she respects after she incidentally saw <i>Nurse Witch Komugi-chan Magikarte</i> when she was still a primary school student. Uesaka described the experience as shocking but it was there that she heard Momoi for the first time and yearned to become a voice actress afterwards. In April, 2011 she joined Space Craft Entertainment's anime section. Starting October 7, 2011 she became a radio personality on A&amp;G NEXT GENERATION Lady Go!!. Following an announcement on August 12 of the same year at the Summer Comic Market 80, it was announced that she had being casted on the 2012 TV anime series <i>Papa no Iukoto wo Kikinasai!</i>. In January 2012 she made her debut as voice actress, lending her voice to the heroine Takanashi Sora. Later Matsu Tomohiro, the original author, and Kawasaki Itsurou, the director, said that she was chosen at the audition despite technical flaws, because they couldn't picture anyone else as Sora. Following her first starring role she became gradually more busy during 2012. \n \nUesaka is an avid fan of Russia and its history, culture, military, literature and art. This traces back to the time when she was a tenth grade student, in her first year of high school, and heard by chance for the first time the Soviet Union national anthem. Henceforth she began to develop an interest in Russia and devoted herself to studying about Russian society and history on her own. She couldn't picture herself studying anything other than Russian language at university. In April 2010, she entered the Faculty of Foreign Studies at the well known Sophia University after a recommendation from Kamakura Women's University Junior &amp; Senior High School where she graduated. There she was majoring in Russian Studies. Her graduation thesis was a study of the early history of the Red Army. On July 10, 2012 she received Sophia University's Studies Prize For Excellent Work. \n \nStarting April, 2012 she received her own radio show, the Uesaka Sumire's Armored Guards Infantry Regiment Broadcast on Nico Nico Live. Because of her familiarity with Russia and interest in its military, she was casted as the Russian girl Nonna on TV anime series <i>Girls und Panzer</i> in October 2012. She also sung two Russian insert songs during the show, \"Cossack no Komoriuta\" and \"Katyusha,\" both covers of well known folk songs. Her performance as voice actress and singer received a lot of attention in Japan and overseas thereafter. \n \nUesaka likes to study languages and is, aside of Russian, proficient in English and Chinese as well, having passed several language proficiency tests. She also likes Lolita Fashion and as such became a model for the Baby, The Stars Shine Bright clothing brand. Photo shoots with her are published frequently in Kera, Gothic &amp; Lolita Bible and other well known magazines. She likes to draw and often posts illustrations on her blog and pixiv account. Her favorite food includes lamb chop and Kinoko no Yama. Her favorite politician is Vyacheslav Molotov, her favorite manga and anime characters are Chirico Cuvie, Duke Tougou and Rudolf von Stroheim. Her favorite tank is the BT-5 produced by the Soviet Union. On May 26, 2012 she served as a one-day captain of the JS Yamayuki at the Marine Fiesta in Funabashi. \n \n(Source: AniDB) \n \nTwitter: @uesaka_official\n  ","name":"Sumire Uesaka","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/8362/original.jpg"},{"id":"7029","description":" \n  Hometown  \n Kanagawa, Japan \nBlood type: O \nAgency: Hirata Office \nHeight: 158.5 cm \nShoes: 24.5 cm \n ","name":"Chiaki Omigawa","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/7029/original.jpg"},{"id":"33249","description":"","name":"Eva Andrés"},{"id":"2964","description":" \n  Twitter  \n @joe_cappelletti \nThe Final Word (His Group ADR Company) \n ","name":"Joe Cappelletti","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/2964/original.jpg"},{"id":"298","description":"  1997 MBC Voice Actor in Korea  ","name":"Jun Seok Song","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/298/original.jpg"},{"id":"2850","description":"","name":"Miho Yoshida","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/2850/original.jpg"},{"id":"24608","description":"  Brazilian voice actress \n \nFacebook: @aninha.bittencourt.7\n  ","name":"Ana Elena Bittencourt","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/24608/original.jpg"},{"id":"6853","description":" \n  Birthplace  \n Minneapolis, Minnesota. \nHeight: 5'2\" \nMarried to Daniel Gillies \nRachael Leigh also participated as a Voice Actress for Final Fantasy VII Advent Children as Tifa Lockhart \n \nTwitter: @RachaelLCook \nIG: @rachaelleighcook\n \n ","name":"Rachael Leigh Cook","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/6853/original.jpg"},{"id":"3753","description":"","name":"Atsushi Ii","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/3753/original.jpg"},{"id":"24296","description":"","name":"Érika Menezes","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/24296/original.jpg"},{"id":"24293","description":" Wikipedia","name":"Caio César de Melo","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/24293/original.jpg"},{"id":"7280","description":"  Birth place: Tokyo, Japan \n \nFuminori Komatsu is married to fellow seiyuu Michiko Komatsu.

She is best known for her work in animated television series. \n \nKayzie's most famous roles are the more than 50 she has voiced for Pokémon. She has been a part of the show since its inception. Other notable portrayals are Pie Tin, in Fighting Foodons; Tuff, in Kirby: Right Back at Ya!; Doozle, in Tama And Friends; Koby, in One Piece; and Sara Ringwalt in Now and Then, Here and There. Rogers has also appeared as the voice of Chicky, the Kid Chicken for KFC; a talking teddy bear for FAO Schwarz, and as a bungee-jumping gum pellet for Trident White. \n \nKayzie says she has been \"doing funny voices\" for as long as she \"can remember\". She caught the acting bug early on, relishing her performances in school plays from kindergarten through college. Rogers's first media job was as an NBC page in Rockefeller Center. She then moved on to a successful graphic arts career, but her dream of working as a professional actor remained a constant. \n \nWith the help of vocal coach, Maddie Blaustein, Kayzie made her first cartoon-voice demo and was almost immediately discovered. She was cast as a bratty little kid in a tolerance PSA (Public service announcement). It was produced by cartoonist, animator, writer and businessman Joe Young (Scruples), starred Richie Havens and featured music by Stevie Wonder. Her first TV series was Nickelodeon's U2U. Kayzie played \"all the high pitched voices for the cartoons\" (Jerry Lobozzo voiced all the deep ones). \n \nKayzie Rogers is best known for her inventive and wacky portrayals as well as her wide vocal and emotional range. In addition to voice acting, Kayzie teaches workshops and performs for charities.

Paul is frequently cast in one of two roles: a brilliantly cunning, evil villain, or a thuggish strong guy. He also plays characters that provide some sense of comic relief, usually a minion of some kind of relatively small size. \n \nArguably, Paul's most notable role as a villainous character would be Naraku from InuYasha, with the manipulative Sideways from Transformers: Armada and the vicious dark-hunter Nidhiki from Bionicle 2: Legends of Metru Nui as close seconds. As the tough guy, he is recognized as the elder Enzo Matrix from ReBoot, and the unstoppable Juggernaut from X-Men Evolution. His prominent comedic roles are Myoga from InuYasha, and Howdy from Hamtaro, as well as Happosai from Ranma ½. He commonly acts alongside his brothers, such as during the hit Bionicle movies B2 and B3, in which he also played Toa Whenua (a strong-guy character), as well as during Ranma 1/2 and Hamtaro. He had voice Doctor Doom in the Fantastic Four: World's Greatest Heroes animated series. \n \nSome of his video game roles, he can be heard as Sgt. Dwight Boykin in Dead Rising 2. Sometime in 2011 with the release of Marvel vs Capcom 3 &amp; Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3, he reprise his role as Doctor Doom, as well as voicing Shuma-Gorath. \n \nAwards: \n- Best Male Supporting Vocal Performance in an Anime Television Series/OVA at 1st Annual BTVA Anime Dub Awards (Staff Choice)  ","name":"Paul Dobson","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/3358/original.jpg"},{"id":"973","description":" \n  Hometown  \n Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan  \nBlood type: A \n ","name":"Wakana Yamazaki","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/973/original.jpg"},{"id":"33553","description":"  Brazilian voice actor.

After a Shakespearean stint in New York in the late 1930s, Corey made the move to Hollywood in 1940, where he became a highly respected character actor. One of his most notable movie roles was in a 1951 feature film, Superman and the Mole Men, which was later edited to a two-part episode of the television series The Adventures of Superman, retitled \"The Unknown People\". His portrayal of a xenophobic vigilante coincidentally reflected what was about to happen to him. \n  \nHis career was halted in the early 1950s, when he was summoned before the House Committee on Un-American Activities. Corey refused to give names of alleged \"Communists\" and \"subversives\" in the entertainment industry and went so far as to ridicule the panel by offering critiques of the testimony of the previous witnesses. This behavior led to his being blacklisted for 12 years. \"Most of us were retired Reds. We had left it, at least I had, years before,\" Corey told Patrick McGilligan, the co-author of \"Tender Comrades: A Backstory of the Hollywood Blacklist\" who also teaches film at Marquette University. \"The only issue was, did you want to just give them their token names so you could continue your career, or not? I had no impulse to defend a political point of view that no longer interested me particularly . . . They just wanted two new names so they could hand out more subpoenas.\" \n \nCorey died on August 16, 2002, from complications from a fall. He was 88 years old.

However, having failed the entrance exam for Takarazuka Music School in her third year of middle-school she joined the Minami Aoyama Shōjo Kageki Dan (南青山少女歌劇団, South Aoyama Female Opera Group?, also called Nanshō for short) a stage group for teenage girls. \n \nHaving had several lead roles over the three years she spent with the troupe, Saeko was then cast in the lead voice acting role of Kotori Haruno in the Sega Dreamcast game Diamond Daydreams. Having had a taste of being a seiyū and deciding that she preferred voice acting to performing on stage, Saeko decided to pursue the career full-time. \n \nSome of her earlier roles include her seiyū debut as Tsubaki Sakura in Kare Kano, Kitsune no Akane in Angel Tales, and Elliot Chapman in Sci-fi Harry. Saeko was famed for her long, straight, black hair and seemingly cold outward appearance which led to her being cast in various tsundere and 'cool-girl' roles. She then cut her hair short in the spring of 2005, which strangely coincided with the increasing diversity of her roles, as Saeko herself noted on the My-HiME fandisc interview. \n \nSaeko has also pursued a singing career with Yuki Kajiura, who wrote music for some of the Nanshō stage shows, writing and producing almost all her material. Her first single was Koi no Kiseki, the theme song for the PlayStation game Meguri Aishite. She has since released nine singles and two albums, along with various character song and drama CDs. She has also performed theme songs for games such as Alundra 2 and Atelier Judie. \n \nSaeko was also part of the group tiaraway with fellow Nanshō member Yuuka Nanri. Originally recording and performing as 'Saeko Chiba &amp; Yuuka Nanri' for Memories Off 2nd, the duo released three singles and an album before breaking up on  March 6 2005. \n ","name":"Saeko Chiba","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/2137/original.jpg"},{"id":"34450","description":"<p><div class=\"people-informantion-more js-people-informantion-more\">Brazilian voice actor.</div></p>","name":"Márcio Sharrembroich"},{"id":"9136","description":"  Birth place: Gangneung, South Korea  ","name":"Doh Hyeong Nam","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/9136/original.jpg"},{"id":"25554","description":"","name":"Javier Lorca"},{"id":"30680","description":" \n  Birthplace  \n Milan, Italy \n ","name":"Stefania De Peppe","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/30680/original.jpg"},{"id":"24802","description":"  Photography Site: @Susan Marque Art  \nFacebook: @susan.marque \nTwitter: @susanmarque \nYoutube: @SusanMarque1 \nBlog: @susanmarque.blogspot\n  ","name":"Susan Marque","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/24802/original.jpg"},{"id":"31747","description":"","name":"Ken Yanai","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/31747/original.jpg"},{"id":"3444","description":"","name":"Yasuko Sawaguchi","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/3444/original.jpg"},{"id":"25873","description":"<p><div class=\"people-informantion-more js-people-informantion-more\">Voice of kitsurubami in the Flcl english dub</div></p>","name":"L.

She basically cited her desire to move on \"as an adult\" with her career. The underlying reason that she had to quit was because it was discovered by the tabloid magazine FRIDAY that she was in a relationship with actor Shun Oguri though she was 22 at the time. Yaguchi and Oguri have reportedly broken up since April of 2006. Yaguchi's TV show Yaguchi Hitori (やぐちひとり?) continues as before, and she now focuses on Japanese variety shows as guests and hosts rather than ventures on a singing career. \nEarly on in the group Yaguchi was often perceived as being \"the short one\" as she did not stand out a lot, but by the time 4th generation joined she had become one of the most active members of the group. Her most famous phrase is \"Sexy Beam!\" one of her solo lines from Morning Musume's \"Koi no Dance Site\" single, and she was asked jokingly in Joshi Kashimashi Monogatari, \"When will your real sexy beam come out?\". The \"Sexy beam!\" line has made its way around fans and fellow musicians alike. When she graduated from Morning Musume she was the last person to join before the year 2000 (Kaori Iida had left nearly 2 months before), and she currently has the fifth longest tenure of any member, with only Takahashi Ai, Niigaki Risa, Hitomi Yoshizawa and Kaori Iida being in the group longer. \nHer first post-Morning Musume recording, \"Nigiyaka na Fuyu\", done as a collaboration with Berryz Kobo, appears as the coupling track on Berryz Kobo's November 2005 single \"Gag 100 Kaibun Aishite Kudasai\". \nYaguchi was the drama queen in a Japanese drama series called Sento no Musume (銭湯の娘!? daughter of public bathhouse?), Yaguchi was one of the main stars in a Japanese day time drama series called Gyarusa (ギャルサ Gal Circle?), along with her show Yaguchi Hitori, and MCing Hello! Project concerts. From May 25, 2007 and up to June 6, 2007, Yaguchi performed in \"Damn Yankees\", a popular 1955 Broadway musical at the Tokyo Aoyama Theater.[1] \nIn summer of 2007, Yaguchi was recruited to host a new Gyao TV show, \"Midtown TV\", becoming her third television show on air. \"Midtown TV\" airs all weekdays and Yaguchi hosts it on Thursdays. Also, Mari and seven H!P Eggs are scheduled to appear live and with audience on \"Ciao TV\", a Kids Station show, on 09/02, 19h~19.30h, on what appears to be yet another TV show. With that commencing, Yaguchi will be in four TV shows being aired simultaneously.[2] \nIt was announced October 19, 2008, on the official Hello! Project website, that Yaguchi, together with the entire Hello! Project Elder Club, will graduate March 31, 2009.[3] A graduation concert was held at Yokohama Arena on February 1, 2009.[4] \nFollowing the popularity of singles and an album released in conjunction with the Japanese variety program, Quiz! Hexagon II (クイズ!ヘキサゴンII?), Yaguchi released her debut single, \"Seishun Boku/Seishun Ore\" (青春 僕/青春 俺?), four years after her final release in Morning Musume. She performed the song for the first time on Quiz! Hexagon II on February 25, 2009. \n \n ","name":"Mari Yaguchi","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/919/original.jpg"},{"id":"481","description":"  Blood type: B \nBirth place: Nagasaki Prefecture, Japan \n \nFormerly known as Kazuhiro Nakata (中多 和宏).

In 1993 Olson was the program director at a radio station in Edmonton, and was involved in a lot of commercial voice work. Olson finally got his chance to enter the world of animation in the late ‘90s through a former graduate of the Radio, Television, and Broadcast News (RTBN) program. Thanks to one of his students being a talent coordinator for Chinook Animations, he was able to audition through Chinook Animation, and ended up landing a role in re-voicing the Dragon Ball series for the ‘Blue Water Dub,’ which meant Olson’s voice was used for broadcasting in TV stations such as YTV, but the episodes for those series were not for distribution. Olson’s most well-known roles in the Dragon Ball universe were as narrator for the series, General Rilldo, Old Supreme Kai, and other additional voices in the akin series Dragon Ball GT. Olson’s background in theatre – a bachelor’s degree in drama, as well as a master’s degree in theatre, play an important role in his voice acting career.

She is currently the voice of Jacobo on Disney's The Replacements, Coco, Madame Foster and Cheese on Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends, Irma Lair on Disney's W.I.T.C.H., lead character Maya Santos on Maya &amp; Miguel (where she speaks fluent Spanish), the punk rocker/goth protegé Ophelia Ramírez on The Life and Times of Juniper Lee, Zadavia in Loonatics Unleashed, and Nick Dean on The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius as reprised from the movie and Nora Wakeman on My Life as a Teenage Robot. Candi is famous for voicing a majority of characters with a thick Latino accent. \n \nA native of San Jose, California, she attended the all-girls Presentation High School. Later, she replaced Christine Cavanaugh as the voice of Dexter in Dexter's Laboratory in 2001 when Ms. Cavanaugh retired from show business, and she was also the voice of Sweetie Pie on Tiny Toons. Her other voice credits include Snap from ChalkZone, The Flea on Mucha Lucha, and the title character in the U.S. version of the 2003 Astro Boy (Tetsuwan Atomu) series. Milo says that when creating a unique voice the artist's drawings speak to her and that she prides herself on creating \"a full life\" for each character.[1] \n \nHer father, Tony, was a child actor. By age sixteen, she was already in theme park shows, most notably those at Disneyland in Anaheim. After appearing in bit roles in the movies, and made occasional appearances as a member of \"The Mighty Carson Art Players\" on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, she accidentally got into voice acting while feeding lines to actors in the Ralph Bakshi animated/live action movie Cool World, and wound up playing Lonette, a sexy animated waitress as well as Bob, a member of Holli Would's gang of goons who was a crossdresser, among a dozen characters. A single mom, she lives in a suburb of Los Angeles, California with her daughter.

In 2002 she got her first major role in an anime tv series, Shichinin no Nana. During the same year, in June, she quit Aksent and signed with talent agency 81 Produce. She became a regular on two radio shows, Sakurai Koubou and Cherry Bell in October 2002. The following years saw her involved with the Da Capo franchise a visual novel, adapted into an anime, where she played one of the main characters, Sagisawa Yoriko. \n \nMatsuki had been under treatment for acute pneumonia since July 2015. \n \nShe passed away on October 27th 2015, due to a complication from the disease. \n \n(Source: AniDB) \n \nMALoween remembers you. \nT\n \n ","name":"Miyu Matsuki","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/2180/original.jpg"},{"id":"31174","description":" \n  Twitter  \n @XanderMobusVO\n \n ","name":"Xander Mobus","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/31174/original.jpg"},{"id":"3131","description":"","name":"Cecília Balogh"},{"id":"1936","description":"  She's a spanish voice actress.

He is also part of the seiyū quartet Weiss consisting of Weiss Kreuz voice castmates Shinichiro Miki, Tomokazu Seki, and Yuuki Hiro. He used to work for Production Baobab but is now the head of T's Factory, a seiyuu company he founded in 1998. \n \nKoyasu is known for his deep, smooth voice, which often lands him in roles that are either villains or lonely bishōnen. Recently, though (as in the cases of Mitsurugi Hanagata from Saber Marionette J, Ryo Kuroyanagi from Yakitate!! Japan, Bobobo-Bo-Bobobo, and Kei Itoshiki from Zoku Sayonara Zetsubo Sensei) he has been voicing more and more lively/humorous characters. According to Hisaya Nakajo, the mangaka of the series Hana-Kimi, the character of Masao Himejima was designed with Koyasu's voice in mind; the seiyū ended up voicing this character in the series' drama CDs. \n \nKoyasu is also the creator of the Weiß series, and has authored the manga Weiß Side B. In creating Weiß Kreuz, Koyasu was inspired by an old Japanese series called Sure Death. \n \nKoyasu often voices under the pseudonym Hayato Jumonji, especially in H anime. \n \nHe also narrates promotional videos and pre-flight safety videos for StarFlyer. \n \nBlood type: A \nHeight: 175 cm \nWeight: 60 kg \nBust-Waist-Hip: 83-65-93 cm  \n \nFavourites: \nBeverages: milk, brandy \nColours: black, white, blue \nCountry: Egypt \nAnimal: Giraffe \nBrands of clothing: Fila, Donna Karan, Van, Ships \nDate spot: the sea \nMusic group: L'arc~en~Ciel \nTV show: \"trendy\" dramas \nFlower: yellow rose \nFoods: ebi, tofu, men's pocky \nIdol: Mita Hiroko \nSeason: autumn \n \nHobbies: \nSnowboarding \nVideo Games \nWriting \n \nSkills &amp; Abilities: \nBaseball \nDesigning signatures \nE Rank Driver \nJump rope \nPhotography  ","name":"Takehito Koyasu","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/423/original.jpg"},{"id":"24716","description":"  Birth place: Niterói, Brazil  ","name":"Isaac Bardavid","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/24716/original.jpg"},{"id":"3816","description":"","name":"Olaf Reichmann","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/3816/original.jpg"},{"id":"24677","description":"","name":"Tetsuji Ota"},{"id":"7130","description":"","name":"Mayumi Terashima","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/7130/original.jpg"},{"id":"6113","description":"  Blood type: O \nBirth place: Hokkaido, Japan  ","name":"Kana Uetake","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/6113/original.jpg"},{"id":"1980","description":" \n  Birthplace  \n New York, U.S.A. \nCurrent residence: Los Angeles, California, U.S.A. \n \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Kether-Donohue/168135249874924 \nTwitter: @MsKetherDonohue \n ","name":"Kether Donohue","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/1980/original.jpg"},{"id":"4595","description":" \n  Hometown  \n Saitama, Japan \nBlood type: O  \n ","name":"Yukari Kokubun","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/4595/original.jpg"},{"id":"34367","description":" \n  Birthplace  \n Berlin, Germany \n ","name":"Natascha Petz","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/34367/original.jpg"},{"id":"5103","description":" AniDB","name":"Harumi Asai","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/5103/original.jpg"},{"id":"28547","description":"","name":"Julian Manuel","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/28547/original.jpg"},{"id":"23228","description":" \n  \n \nTwitter  \n @RagsdaleSara \n ","name":"Sara Ragsdale","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/23228/original.jpg"},{"id":"2705","description":"  Date of death: 2009-10-24   ","name":"Yasuo Iwata","portrait":"https://media.kitsu.io/people/images/2705/original.jpg"},{"id":"30977","description":"","name":"Doris Jensen"},{"id":"7539","description":" \n  Hometown  \n Tochigi, Japan \nHeight: 171 cm \n \nHobbies: \nBass \nKaraoke \nReading \n \nPart of MM3 with Ryoutaro Abe and Tomohiro Watanabe, which Disbanded after Gokujou!!

The son of actor Eugene Osment and teacher Theresa Osment, Haley was chosen for a commercial at age four after a casting director spotted him in a furniture store with his parents. Within months, he had landed a small but memorable role as Tom Hanks's son in Forrest Gump (1994) and a starring role as Edward Asner's grandson on the TV series \"Thunder Alley\" (1994). His comedy skills were manifest very young, and he followed \"Thunder Alley\" (1994) with two more sitcoms. Norman Jewison gave him his first leading role on the big screen in Bogus (1996), and he proved completely at ease in this dramatic role. However, it took the smash hit The Sixth Sense (1999) to brand the young actor on the public consciousness. His devastating performance as the haunted Cole Sear brought him an Oscar nomination at age 11 and a memorable tribute at the awards from winner Michael Caine: \"Once I learned of your nomination and saw your performance, I knew for sure you would win.\" Since then, Osment has given an equally powerful performance in Pay It Forward (2000). Along with bravura performances, he has developed an equal reputation in the industry for unspoiled professionalism. His younger sister, Emily Osment, has made several impressive film and television appearances as well.

Before moving out of the Los Angeles area, she did several anime voice roles mostly under the names Emily Brown, Mary Cobb and Marie Downing. One of her earliest voice acting roles was Annie Labelle in the 1980s crossover anime hit Robotech when she was 13 years old. \n \nIn 2001, Emilie teamed up with her sister Rachel Coleman to create Signing Time!—an entertaining children's public television and video series that teaches basic American Sign Language (ASL) to children of all abilities. In 1996, Rachel and her husband Aaron discovered that their oldest daughter Leah was deaf. From the beginning, they have found that teaching her 'hearing' peers even a few basic signs builds bonds of friendship and community that every child needs. \n \nEmilie's first son, Alex—one year younger than Leah-- made his first sign at 10 months of age by telling his mom he wanted \"milk.\" Emilie has seen first-hand the communication benefits that ASL offers all children, including miraculous results for children with special needs. \n \nIn addition to being a mom, Emilie is the co-creator, director, and producer of the Signing Time series. After graduating from Brigham Young University in 1996 with a theatre degree, she continued her career in the entertainment industry, doing voiceover work for countless TV and radio commercials, cartoons, CD-ROMs, television shows and major motion pictures. Emilie has been the creative force behind the development of concepts, scripts, film and post-production of over 26 Signing Time! episodes, as well as Baby Signing Time, Practice Time and all other Two Little Hands Productions.
